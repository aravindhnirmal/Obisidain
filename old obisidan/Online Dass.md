From 1990 to 1994, [Owen Astrachan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Astrachan "Owen Astrachan"), Vivek Khera and David Kotz ran one of the first distributed, internet-based programming contests inspired by the ICPC.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming#cite_note-5)

Interest in competitive programming has grown extensively since 2000 to tens of thousands of participants (see [Notable competitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming#Notable_competitions)), and is strongly connected to the growth of the Internet, which facilitates holding international contests online, eliminating geographical problems.

## Overview[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Competitive_programming&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Overview")]

The aim of competitive programming is to write [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code "Source code") of computer programs which are able to solve given problems. A vast majority of problems appearing in programming contests are mathematical or logical in nature. Typical such tasks belong to one of the following categories: [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics "Combinatorics"), [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory "Number theory"), [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory "Graph theory"), [algorithmic game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_game_theory "Algorithmic game theory"), [computational geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry "Computational geometry"), [string analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science) "String (computer science)"), [discrete mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics "Discrete mathematics") and [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure "Data structure").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming#cite_note-6) Problems related to [constraint programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming "Constraint programming") and [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") are also popular in certain competitions.

Irrespective of the problem category, the process of solving a problem can be divided into two broad steps: constructing an efficient [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm"), and implementing the algorithm in a suitable [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") (the set of programming languages allowed varies from contest to contest). These are the two most commonly tested skills in programming competitions.

In most contests, the judging is done automatically by host machines, commonly known as judges. Every solution submitted by a contestant is run on the judge against a set of (usually secret) test cases. Normally, contest problems have an all-or-none marking system, meaning that a solution is "Accepted" only if it produces satisfactory results on all test cases run by the judge, and is rejected otherwise. However, some contest problems may allow for partial scoring, depending on the number of test cases passed, the quality of the results, or some other specified criteria. Some other contests only require that the contestant submit the output corresponding to given input data, in which case the judge only has to analyze the submitted output data.

Online judges are online environments in which testing takes place. Online judges have rank lists showing users with the biggest number of accepted solutions and/or shortest execution time for a particular problem.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming#cite_note-7)

In most of the above competitions, competitions are usually organized in several rounds. They usually start with online rounds, which conclude in the onsite final round. The top performers at IOI and ICPC receive gold, silver and bronze medals. In the other contests, cash prizes are awarded to the top finishers. The competitions also attract the interest of recruiters from multiple software and Internet companies, which often reach out to competitors with potential job offers.

## Online platforms[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Competitive_programming&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Online platforms")]

The programming community around the world has created and maintained several internet-resources dedicated to competitive programming. They offer standalone contests with or without minor prizes. Also the past archives of problems are a popular resource for training in competitive programming. There are several organizations that host programming competitions on a regular basis. These include:
