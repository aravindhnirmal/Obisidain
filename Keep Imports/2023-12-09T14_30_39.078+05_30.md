Interprocedural optimization (IPO) is a compiler optimization technique that analyzes and optimizes code across multiple functions or procedure  inter-procedural optimization technique used by compilers to improve the performance of a program by replacing function calls with the actual code of the function. reduce the overhead of function calls by eliminating the need for a call instruction and return instruction to be executed
Inline substitution is a technique used in inter-procedural optimization where the code of a called function is substituted or replaced directly into the calling function, eliminating the need for a function call.
is an effective optimization technique, but it should be used with caution. Inlining large functions can increase the size of the resulting code, which can negatively impact cache performance and increase code size.

There are different call site scenarios in inline substitution:

Simple call site: This is the most basic form of inline substitution, where the call site consists of a single function call with no arguments or return values.

Complex call site: This call site involves multiple function calls, which may have different argument types and return values. The compiler needs to determine the order in which the functions are called and how the arguments are passed between them.

Recursive call site: This is a special case of the complex call site, where the function calls itself. The compiler needs to be careful to avoid an infinite loop.

Indirect call site: In this call site, the function to be called is determined dynamically at runtime, rather than being fixed at compile time. This makes it difficult to inline the code, as the compiler may not know which function will be called
