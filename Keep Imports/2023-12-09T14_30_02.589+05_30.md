 Encapsulation
inheritance, 
polymorphism, 
 abstraction

Encapsulation:
public, private, protected, or package-private (default). 
get ,set method

get -return
set la -this parameter la ulla  



Inheritance:
Inheritance enables code reuse and promotes a hierarchical organization of classes, facilitating the creation of specialized classes based on existing ones

@override - na same method but u write differs int,prints

mulitlevel inheritance class b extend a ,class C extends B

mulitilevel inhertinace na diamond problem so not to allow and use interface


abstraction : synopsis
class also incomplete means abstraction,many proper methods but one abstract method na total class is abstract,not to give proper def
oru abstract class irutha total class is abstract

object make? no abstract cannot be object making
not in var
abstraction class la non abstract method irutha 
access by inheritance 
abstract method ta nalla def pannum illa inherit class sum abstract class thaan

abstraction -inheritance 


make another class for object creation for abstract class 
define the abstract class in that make the object in the non abstract class of abstract class and fuillfill the abstract method and acess the non abstract method and alos non private method


( ); or ( ) {  }

abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();

    void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("This is a shape.");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape circleShape = new Circle();
        circleShape.draw();       // Output: "Drawing a circle."
        circleShape.displayInfo(); // Output: "This is a shape."
    }
}


abstract class in Java can have any access modifier, such as public, protected, default

interface

100%abstract class no full class

no given in abstract keyword in every fun in interface class
