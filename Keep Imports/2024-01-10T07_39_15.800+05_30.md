Certainly, here's a summary of the phases of a software project as outlined in your course material. This summary can be helpful for your exam preparation:

1. **Requirements Gathering and Analysis:**
   - Gather and document specific software requirements.
   - Involves understanding customer needs and aggregating requirements from potential customers.
   - Documented in System Requirements Specification (SRS) acting as a bridge between customers and designers.

2. **Planning:**
   - Define schedule, scope, and resource requirements for a release.
   - Create a plan on how to meet requirements and determine what will be met or not.
   - Consider resource availability, milestones, and release date.
   - Deliver project and test plan documents by the end of this phase.

3. **Design:**
   - Determine how to satisfy the requirements from SRS.
   - Design phase document used in the development phase.
   - Purposes include verifying that all requirements are met and providing information to the development phase.
   - Includes both high-level and low-level design.
   - Produces System Design Description (SDD).

4. **Development or Coding:**
   - Coding based on the design, which acts as the blueprint.
   - Programs are written in the chosen programming language.
   - Produces software that fulfills the documented requirements.
   - Involves creating product documentation alongside the coding process.

5. **Testing:**
   - Exercising the software product in predefined ways.
   - Aims to verify that the observed behavior matches the planned behavior.
   - Identifies and removes defects before the software is shipped to customers.

6. **Deployment and Maintenance:**
   - Deploy the software at the client's location.
   - Detect and address any discrepancies found.
   - Maintenance includes corrective, adaptive, and preventive activities:
      - Corrective: Addressing customer-related problems.
      - Adaptive: Making the software compatible with new versions of OS or database.
      - Preventive: Eliminating potential security vulnerabilities.

These phases represent the typical stages of a software project, from gathering requirements to deployment and maintenance. Make sure to review and understand each phase to excel in your exam. Good luck!
