 College is good for some people. If you’re training to become a physician or  a lawyer, attending college is an essential requirement. Please go to college.
But it’s a different story for entrepreneurs! Ever since I was a kid, my goal has been to be an entrepreneur. College is not requirement for my career ambitions, and I wish I hadn’t gone.

College did not teach me critical thinking.

I believe that an entrepreneur's greatest asset is critical thinking.

What college didn’t teach me, I had to learn on my own.

I understand that It’s difficult to tell someone how to think critically. Here’s the process I came up with for teaching myself critical thinking:

When I face a difficult problem in business, life, or whatever, I think to myself, there is a solution.

I write down 5-10 possible solutions, no matter how crazy they might seem..

I try out 1-3 of the best ideas.

After I’ve tried a few, I write another 5-10 solutions. The crazier, the better.

I try 1-3 of best ideas from this list.

Gradually, I get closer to solving the problem.

Here’s why this works. Shaking your mind with crazy ideas can lead you closer to the one or two right ideas that could solve your problem.

Critical thinking is all about an insane level of determination, scary amounts of creativity, and a persistent drive to solve the problem.

Eventually, you’ll get closer to a solution, and achieve a breakthrough

I understand that It’s difficult to tell someone how to think critically. Maybe college wasn’t designed to do that. Maybe some colleges are good at this, and I just lucked out. Here’s the process I came up with for teaching myself critical thinking:

I took a few classes that had some group projects, speeches, and papers. But for the most part, the learning model was one of: 1) Memorize. 2) Repeat.

My learning style (and I expect the learning style of others) isn’t memorize/repeat, but rather experience and do.


College is the best way to learn about structural integrity, so your bridge doesn’t fall down. Med school is a great way to learn where the inferior vena cava is, so you don’t slice through the wrong thing.


College isn’t a shortcut to success. In fact, it may be a roadblock to your success
