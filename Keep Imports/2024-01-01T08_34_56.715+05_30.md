Dark Reading, Krebs on Security, The Hacker News and SecurityWeek to immerse yourself in the realm of cybersecurity,cybersecurity groups on websites like Reddit, LinkedIn, Discord and surfing on internet may provide offer insightful information and chances to interact with experts and enthusiasts


Define your specific area of interest within cybersecurity, whether it's network security, ethical hacking, or digital forensics

Learn the fundamentals of solid computer networking. You can take free classes to learn about TCP/IP, network protocols, and data flow through networks at websites like Cisco Networking Academy, Cybrary, and TryHackMe. There are several YouTubers, like Professor Messer, Farah Hawa, The Cyber Mentor.


Over the course of your cyber security career, Linux will become your best friend. These operating systems' free online guides and tutorials can provide you a firm foundation in ideas like file systems, permissions, and command-line interfaces


. Free resources such as the "Cybersecurity Essentials" course on Cybrary or the "Introduction to Cybersecurity" course on FutureLearn, the TryHackMe platform can provide a solid foundation. Paid resources like TCM Security’s courses or the eLearnSecurity’s Penetration Testing Student Course as well as certification can be found immensely useful to get the kickstart to the career in cyber security




Dive into the fascinating realm of encryption and cryptography. Free resources like Cryptography tutorials on Khan Academy or the "Cryptography I" course offered by Stanford University on Coursera or even the YouTube channels can help you understand encryption algorithms, symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, and cryptographic protocols.
Develop familiarity with crucial security technologies such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), virtual private networks (VPNs), and secure web protocols (HTTPS). Free resources from vendors like Cisco, Palo Alto Networks, and Fortinet can provide documentation and tutorials. Even the TryHackMe provides with good quality of explanation to the topics mentioned. 
Understand common web vulnerabilities, including cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and CSRF attacks. Free resources such as the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) guides and tutorials or PortSwigger's Web Security Academy can deepen your knowledge. For comprehensive learning, premium course like "Web Application Penetration Testing" on eLearnSecurity.





Free resources like the Metasploit Unleashed project, OWASP's "WebGoat" or "Juice Shop", Vulnhub platform are some of the vulnerable applications and platforms which offer practical platforms to practice hacking techniques. Practical experience is invaluable in the cybersecurity field. Engage in Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges available on platforms like Hack The Box, TryHackMe, or OverTheWire's Bandit. Additionally, practice on deliberately vulnerable virtual machines like Metasploitable, OWASP BWA, or Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) to apply your skills in realistic scenarios.





While ethical hacking is essential, understanding defensive security measures is equally important. Free resources like "Security Operations" courses on Cybrary or the "Introduction to Incident Response" course on FutureLearn can provide insights. For comprehensive learning, premium courses such as "Security Operations and Incident Response" on Pluralsight or the "Certified Incident Handler (GCIH)" course offered by SANS Institute are highly recommended




Next step is to purse a certification in the area of interest. Obtaining industryrecognized certifications not only validates your skills but also enhances your credibility and job prospects.specialize in areas such as network security, application security, or digital forensics. This specialization allows you to tailor your learning and career path according to your goals. Investigate advanced courses and resources relevant to your chosen specialization. Platforms like Pluralsight, LinkedIn Learning, eLearnSecurity, CodeRed by EC-Council, TCM Security, Cybrary and Udemy offer a wide range of premium courses to enhance your skills and knowledge
