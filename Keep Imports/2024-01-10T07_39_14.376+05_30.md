in healthcare, as timely and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Currently, stroke diagnosis and outcome prediction rely heavily on subjective clinical judgment, which can result in misdiagnosis and suboptimal treatment decisions. The use of machine learning algorithms and the Python programming language presents an opportunity to address this problem by developing more objective and accurate methods for stroke diagnosis and outcome prediction. The problem statement for Stroke Diagnosis and Outcome Prediction using Python and machine learning algorithms is to leverage the capabilities of these technologies to develop models that accurately diagnose stroke and predict patient outcomes, improving the quality of care for stroke patients.
