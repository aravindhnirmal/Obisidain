The conclusion: –

    Never compare your marks with your friends 
    Never compare Test Series marks with Actual Exam.
    Do not ignore aptitude and maths if possible do it as early as possible.
    Do not leave any subject.
    Revision is your girlfriend you have to take care of her. Otherwise, she will ruin your life.
    Prepare every day. Do not focus on a number of hours.
    Be prepare for everything. What I mean is don't assume that your paper will be easy or tough.
    Remember “All late nights and early mornings will pay off”.

Still at the end. I am satisfied with my score. GATE taught me how to manage time, how to handle pressure, and whether you are from tier 1 college or tier 4 college it will not matter. My suggestion is at least one time in your life to prepare for a competitive exam it will teach many things
