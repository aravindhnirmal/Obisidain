Suppose that the data mining task is to cluster points (with (x, y) representing location)
into three clusters, where the points are
A1(2,10),A2(2,5),A3(8,4),B1(5,8),B2(7,5),B3(6,4),C1(1,2),C2(4,9).
The distance function is Euclidean distance. Suppose initially we assign A1, B1, and C1
as the center of each cluster, respectively. Use the k-means algorithm to show only
(a) The three cluster centers after the first round of execution.
(b) The final three clusters.

10.3 Use an example to show why the k-means algorithm may not find the global optimum,
that is, optimizing the within-cluster variation.

10.4 For the k-means algorithm, it is interesting to note that by choosing the initial cluster
centers carefully, we may be able to not only speed up the algorithmâ€™s convergence, but
also guarantee the quality of the final clustering. The k-means++ algorithm is a variant of k-means, which chooses the initial centers as follows. First, it selects one center
uniformly at random from the objects in the data set. Iteratively, for each object p other
than the chosen center, it chooses an object as the new center. This object is chosen at
random with probability proportional to dist(p)
2
, where dist(p) is the distance from p
to the closest center that has already been chosen. The iteration continues until k centers
are selected.

Explain why this method will not only speed up the convergence of the k-means
algorithm, but also guarantee the quality of the final clustering results.
