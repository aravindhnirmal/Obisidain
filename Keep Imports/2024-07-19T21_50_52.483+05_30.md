in packets are called segments
logical communication b/t processes
1.tcp
1.connection setup
flow control
conge.control

2. udp


multiplexin adn demultiopinxg 
udp
rdt
tcp

mux ande demux

multiplex
performed at sender
handle data form multiple sockets and add transport header

dem
performed at receiver
use header infromation to deliver the received segments to the correct sockets

demultilexing
each datagram haves == sources ip address destination ip adress and carries the one transport layesr segment and segmesnt has sources ports numbesr and destination port number and IP address and Port numbesr used to direct the segment to appropicartes segment

tcp-connection oriented adn udp connectionless
In connection less only destination ip and port number used for delivering the segment(packets ) to processes

in connection oriented it make a pipe connection and it has source ,destination IP,Source port number and destination Port number 


udp 

not adding
best erffot 
no guranntees 
connectionless
no guranntees and no connection establishment or maintenance
why we choose
it simpler and ,smmal  header sizea and no congestion control,more speed 
where;
multimedia streaming

Checksum
>sender
>Rceiver/
PICS
sum

RDT
unidirectional data transfer an d control info will flow on both directon and finite state to specify the sender and receiver

RDT1.0
NO BIT errors ,LOSS OF PACKETS 
sender senda data into underlaying channel,receer revicing 
underlying channel
no fedback  and no ack

RDT2.0 STOP AND WAIT PROTOCOL

+ve and -ve acks
errror detection 
and fedback 
retransmission :error in received packet and retransmitted by the sender
PICS





TCP
P2P
one sender and one receiver and correction oriented :handshaking(exchange of control message)
reliable 
Pipelined bidirectional data flow in same connection
sender willont overhelm the receiver
PICS
 how to estimate RTT?

SampleRTT:measured time
from segment transmission until
ACK receipt

ignore retransmissions

SampleRTT will vary, want
estimated RTT “smoother”

how tcp gives rdt->it has pipelined segments,culmulative acks and single retransmission timer
retransmission triggered by :
timeout events and duplicate acks
sender

congestion control
too many senders sending too fast 
one sender tooo fast for one receiver
long delays(queue in the router buffers)
As delay increases, performance decreases, it causes packet loss
differ from flow control...

no change in router 



approaches towards congestion control

end 2 end congestion 
no explicit fedback form network
