The address generated by the CPU is a logical address,
 whereas the address actually seen by the memory hardware is a physical address.

Addresses bound at compile time or load time have identical logical and physical addresses.

Addresses created at execution time, however, have different logical and physical addresses.


User programs work entirely in logical address space

 the logical address is also known as a virtual address
