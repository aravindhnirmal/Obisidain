Don't know anything about postal study package. But, I'm enrolled in Go classes for GATE DA. Their course is pretty nice but you need lots of patience and persistence to go through their lectures, they very often repeat the same concepts twice or thrice in the same video to make you understand concepts. It's a positive for me since I have time on my hands but idk if you would have enough time to do it.
