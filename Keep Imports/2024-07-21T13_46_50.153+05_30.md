Yeah got 7.9 cgpa from a tier 3 college which had good placement but I wanted something more. In 3rd year (2022) didn't clear cut off, 2022, 4th year, 3 months prep 2.5k rank, 2024 one year drop, 971 rank.

I studied the most during my drop. Consistency is key, don't take drop without a job, not good for mental health, personal experience.

Take a coaching with live classes, it will help you in maintaining routine and also you will get workbooks, pyqs to solve. A 4 hour continuous class is very helpful to create patience and concentration.

Give yourself targets and be accountable if you don't reach them. Don't go in negative zone. Remind yourself of the reason for attempting such exam.

Give many mock exams. Gate zeal and go classes are more than enough. Not just full test exams, small topic wise exams also helpful. Keep a note of the hard questions and the ones you couldn't do during that time. Write down solutions and revisit them.

Keep your chin up, remember Kota factory motivations, every point of serious preparation will lead you to those quotes and gyans. Keep a good relationship with your parents, make them your friend, it's important.

You have time, know why you wanna do gate. What's your goal? What you wanted out of BTech that you missed and wanna find in MTech. Please don't say placement...I hope you don't.

Keep practising coding only if you can, coz after gate they might ask coding during screening tests.
