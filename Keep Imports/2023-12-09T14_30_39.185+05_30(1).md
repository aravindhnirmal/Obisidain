Data transformation involves converting the raw data into a format that is more suitable for analysis, by applying a series of techniques such as scaling, normalization, and feature extraction. For example, data transformation might involve scaling the data to a common range, such as between 0 and 1, to make it easier to compare values across different variables. It might also involve extracting new features from the existing data, such as computing ratios or differences between different variables.

Data discretization, on the other hand, involves dividing continuous data into discrete categories or bins. This can simplify the analysis and make it easier to interpret the results, especially when dealing with large datasets. For example, data discretization might involve grouping age ranges into categories such as "under 18", "18-25", "26-35", and so on
