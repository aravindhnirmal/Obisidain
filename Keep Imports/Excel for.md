Category of supervised learning
Binary(no, yes. Ex :does this picture contain a hotdog - predefined right and wrong answer uses supervised learning depends upon the labelled data)
Multi class classification (in that many options ,almost limitless possible categories,and classified predefined categories Ex ;sandwich,beer, idly)
Regression ( tend to have a continuous solution. whether the hotel is booked or not ,it is binary whether how many room are are likely to booked ,range of possibilities
You show to the machine what is full or empty room? 
Linear regression




The pics is (idea)decision tree in the machine learning 



K nearnest neighbour( instant based ML algorithm,very common machine learning algorithm for multiclass classification,lazy learning,it si difficult for very large data sets)
To learn more about your data is by classifying it with what you already know
You can group the data based on similar characteristics. Beacuse u already known you can classify the data by using supervised machine learning 


In graph of k learning the minimize the distance between the unknown and known is the key point




Another common ML is K means clustering not equal to K-NN BOTH HAVE COMMON STARTING LETTER IS SAME
IT IS UNSUPERVISED ML 
YOU'LL USE IT TO CREATE CLUSTERS BASED ON WHAT YOUR MACHINE SEE
data is cluster by the data given example the retailers classified three type of customer 1.loyal,2.somewhat loyal customer 3.low priced customer

Try to create stragites fir the uplift the somewhat loyal to loyal customer
If they Come to one cluster ,it is easily to improve their business by what the  wanted and why they wanted?


Both are instance based or lazy learning.that means you get all the answers in one big splash .
If change in data,rerun the algorithms from scratch



Regression
 Regression analysis looks at the relationship between predictors and your outcome.
 Predictors -input variable, independent variables,or even regressors. And draw a line between them is trend line

Once you have trained data ,you make predication, and then see how close  you Are to the outcome.
It is supervised ML algorithm
Linear regression is common type of ML 
In this you will create a st.line that shows the ur predicatior ,and outcome 

Supervised = classify data
Unsupervised= classify data


Naive Bayes
 Bayesian algorithm based on theroy of statistics
 Naive because all of the predictiors are independent from one another
 It is for both binary it multi classification of
