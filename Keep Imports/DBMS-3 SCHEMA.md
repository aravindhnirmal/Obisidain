External/ View level
This is the highest level of database abstraction. It includes a number of external schemas or user views. This level provides different views of the same database for a specific user or a group of users. An external view provides a powerful and flexible security mechanism by hiding the parts of the database from a particular user.

Conceptual or Logical level
This level describes the structure of the whole database. It acts as a middle layer between the physical storage and user view. It explains what data to be stored in the database, what the data types are, and what relationship exists among those data. There is only one conceptual schema per database.


Internal or Physical level
This is the lowest level of database abstraction. It describes how the data is stored in the database and provides the methods to access data from the database. It allows viewing the physical representation of the database on the computer system
