Ppnt in the graph and fit all the points (not necessary)best fit line
Y=mx+c
X- x value
m- slope
C - intercepted of u (differ of origin and y point intercepted or where the line start)

Slope is orientation of line slope change Orient change

Y=mx+c
P1(2,7)
P2(3,9)
M=y2-y1/x2-x1.      =2
It tells if c change one unit the y axis point change by 2


C intercept
Y=2x+c
Point (4,11)
Y=2x+c
C finded 


Different type of linear regression but concept is same

More than two variables? By plane

Multiple linear regression. -one depend variable with one or more independent variable
