3D views can be obtained by reflecting a raster image from a
vibrating, flexible mirror

As the mirror vibrates, the focal length varies so that each point in
the scene is reflected to a spatial position corresponding to its depth

Stereoscopic devices present two views of a scene: one for the left
eye and the other for the right eye
