Graphical Intermediate Code Representations (GICRs) are graphical representations of the intermediate code generated during the compilation process. GICRs provide a high-level view of the program structure and flow, which can be useful for analyzing and optimizing code.

GICRs can take many different forms, including trees, graphs, and other visual representations. These representations can help developers to understand the relationships between different parts of the program and to identify potential performance bottlenecks or other issue.

 ASTs are tree structures that represent the abstract syntactic structure of the program code. Each node in an AST represents a specific syntactic construct, such as a function call, a loop, or a conditional statement. ASTs are useful for analyzing and manipulating code

Control Flow Graph (CFG). CFGs are directed graphs that represent the flow of control within a program. Each node in a CFG represents a basic block of code, and edges represent the possible paths of execution between blocks


Data Flow Graphs (DFGs) are another type of GICR that represent the flow of data within a program. Each node in a DFG represents a specific operation that transforms data, and edges represent the data dependencies between operation


Call Graphs are a type of GICR that represent the relationships between functions or methods in a program. Each node in a call graph represents a function or method, and edges represent the calling relationships between functions.
