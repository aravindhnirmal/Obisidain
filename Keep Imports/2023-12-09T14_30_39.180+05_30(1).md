DATA CLEANING
The process of data cleaning typically involves the following steps:

Data auditing: In this step, the data is examined to identify any potential errors or inconsistencies, such as missing values, incorrect data types, or inconsistent formatting.

Data profiling: This step involves analyzing the data to identify any patterns or trends, such as the frequency of certain values or the distribution of data across different variables.

Data cleansing: Once the errors and inconsistencies have been identified, they can be corrected or removed. For example, missing data can be imputed using techniques such as mean imputation or regression imputation. Outliers can be identified and removed, or treated using statistical techniques such as winsorization or trimming.

Data transformation: This step involves converting the data into a format that is more suitable for analysis. For example, categorical data can be encoded as numerical values, or continuous data can be discretized into categories.

Data integration: If the data is being combined from multiple sources, it may be necessary to integrate the data to ensure consistency and accuracy. This may involve identifying and resolving any discrepancies or conflicts between the data sources.

Data validation: Finally, the cleaned and transformed data is validated to ensure that it meets the desired quality standards. This may involve comparing the cleaned data to external sources or performing statistical tests to confirm its accuracy and reliability.
