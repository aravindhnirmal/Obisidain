List ;
   Square bracket
   Separate with comma
   All type of data
   Ordered
   Access by indexing
   Negative indexing also
   Inside of list also
   Mutuable
   Dynamic 
   
 Tuples;
     Parenthess enclosed with
     In type of tuple end with comma that take the type is tuple
     Immutable
     Different data types
     Indexing +,-
     Fast than list



Dictionary;
      {,,,}
      Key1 ;value1
      Key immutable, unique
      {J:3,k:4,j;6}
      O/p is {j:6,k:6}
      List in tuple errors.  d={[1,2]:a}
      Unordered
      Allow the values also

Set;
   Unique elts
   {.  }
   Repeat elts are removed, duplicate elts are removed
   Mutuable
   {[1,2,3],3}
   Unordered
   To print the list use loops 
   For in in s:
       Print(i)


         User defined
         
 Stack:
        Store the data in last in first out or first in last out
        
Plate4
Plate3
Plate2
Plate1
Its like bucket

Push,pop,peek,isempty


Push -add in the stack
Pop-last is remove from stack



implementation in list
Push -->append,add
Pop--->pop, delete


Stack=[ ]
Stack.append(10)
Stack.append(12)
Stack.append(15)
Stack
[10,12,15]
Stack.pop()
Stack
[10,12]


Access the list in the negative indexing

Implementation stacks using list
