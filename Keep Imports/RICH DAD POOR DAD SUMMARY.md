gain control of their financial future,this book has many insights,i will tell some of them

the author start with he had two father not a genetical,namely rich and poor father one of highly educated with phd and another r father never finished the eighth grade.
one always struggled  financially. The other would become one of the richest men in Hawaii.  Having two dads offered the author  the choice of contrasting points of view: one of a rich man and one of a poor man. like , one dad would say, “The love of money is the root of all evil.” The other said, “The lack of money is the root of all evil.”, he continuously asking himself questions such as, “Why does he say that?” and then asking the same question of the other dad’s statement.Instead, having two dads whom I loved forced me to think and ultimately choose a way of thinking for myself.poor parents tell their child about money? They simply say, “Stay in school and study hard.”
Schools focus on scholastic and  professional skills, 
but not on financial  skills.
