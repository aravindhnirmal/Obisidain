Here is a roadmap for learning Data Structures and Algorithms:

Step 1: Introduction to Programming Concepts

Basic concepts of programming such as variables, data types, conditionals, loops, and functions.
Get familiar with at least one programming language such as Python, Java or C++.
Step 2: Basic Data Structures

Learn about arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues and their operations.
Implement these data structures in the programming language you have chosen.
Step 3: Basic Algorithms

Sorting algorithms: Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort.
Searching algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search.
Step 4: Advanced Data Structures

Trees: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees.
Graphs: BFS, DFS, Shortest Path Algorithms.
Hash Tables.
Step 5: Advanced Algorithms

Divide and Conquer Algorithms: Merge sort, Quick sort.
Greedy Algorithms: Knapsack problem, Huffman Coding.
Dynamic Programming: 0/1 Knapsack problem, Longest Common Subsequence.
Step 6: Advanced Concepts

Time and Space complexity analysis.
Recursion.
Bit Manipulation.
Step 7: Practice

Solve problems on coding platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces.
Participate in coding competitions.
Implement projects using data structures and algorithms.
