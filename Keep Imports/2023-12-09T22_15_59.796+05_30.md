Data Structure is a way to store and organize the data in order to facilitate access and modification to the data.

, it helps to build problem solving mindset. And programming is almost all about problem solving. We can adapt any programming language syntax but the problem solving skill can't be adapted overnight

What I Have To Learn?
Algorithm Design
Algorithm Analysis
Algorithm Techniques
How to improve the time and space complexity
Advanced Data Structures (Trees, Graphs,etc.)

So I started a Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization by University Of California, San Diego on coursera
