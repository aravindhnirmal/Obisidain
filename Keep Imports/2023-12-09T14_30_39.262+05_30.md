One emerging data repository architecture is the data warehouse (Section 1.3.2).
This is a repository of multiple heterogeneous data sources organized under a unified schema at a single site to facilitate management decision making.

data rich but information poor situation
a truly interdisciplinary subject.
â€œknowledge mining from data"
knowledge discovery from data, or KDD
: Data mining is the process of discovering interesting patterns and
knowledge from large amounts of data
A data warehouse
is a repository of information collected from multiple sources, stored under a unified
schema, and usually residing at a single site

Classification is the process of finding a model (or function) that describes and distinguishes data classes or concept

A data set may contain objects that do not comply with the general behavior or model
of the data. These data objects are outliers.

It is critical for businesses to acquire a better understanding of the commercial context
of their organization, such as their customers, the market, supply and resources, and
competitors. Business intelligence (BI) technologies provide historical, current, and
predictive views of business operations.. Moreover, clustering plays a central role in customer relationship
management, which groups customers based on their similarities.
Multidimensional data mining (also called exploratory multidimensional data
mining) integrates core data mining techniques with OLAP-based multidimensional analysis. It searches for interesting patterns among multiple combinations
of dimensions (attributes) at varying levels of abstraction, thereby exploring multidimensional data space



Nominal attributes. Suppose that hair color and marital status are two attributes
describing person object
is customor ID, with possible values that are all numeric. However,
in such cases, the numbers are not intended to be used quantitatively
e age is a numeric attribute

ordinal attribute is an attribute with possible values that have a meaningful order or
ranking among them
A numeric attribute is quantitative;


 data quality, including accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness,
believability, and interpretability.
