 Explore the two interface routines used in symbol table

The symbol table is a data structure used by compilers and interpreters to store information about the identifiers (variables, functions, classes, etc.) used in the source code. The symbol table is used during the compilation or interpretation process to resolve references to these identifiers and to perform type checking.

The symbol table can be seen as a map between the identifiers and their attributes, such as their type, scope, address, and other relevant information. To manage this data, the symbol table typically provides two interface routines: insert() and lookup().

Insert() routine:
The insert() routine is used to add a new identifier to the symbol table. When a new identifier is encountered during the parsing or scanning of the source code, its attributes are collected and stored in the symbol table using the insert() routine. If the identifier already exists in the symbol table, an error message may be issued, or the previous attributes of the identifier may be updated.

Lookup() routine:
The lookup() routine is used to search for an identifier in the symbol table and retrieve its attributes. When a reference to an identifier is encountered in the source code, the lookup() routine is used to find the attributes of the identifier in the symbol table. If the identifier is not found, an error message may be issued, or a default value may be returned.

The insert() and lookup() routines are critical to the operation of the symbol table, and their efficiency and correctness are important factors in the overall performance of the compiler or interpreter.





 a control flow graph (CFG), a hot path refers to a path that is executed frequently or has a high probability of being executed during program execution. Identifying and optimizing hot paths can significantly improve program performance by reducing the amount of time spent in these frequently executed portions of the code. Some common techniques for optimizing hot paths include loop unrolling, code motion, and cache optimization





Constant folding is an optimization technique that eliminates expressions that calculate a value that can already be determined before code execution. These are typically calculations that only reference constant values or expressions that reference variables whose values are constant.
