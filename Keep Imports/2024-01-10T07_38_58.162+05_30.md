Certainly, I've summarized the key points from the provided content to help you prepare for your exam:

**White Box Testing: Dynamic White Box Testing**
- Goal: To find bugs.
- Debugging: Goal is to fix bugs.
- Software Tester: Identifies the simplest test case that demonstrates a bug.
- Programmer: Determines the root cause of bugs and attempts to fix them.

**Static Testing: Introduction**
- Involves evaluating code and project deliverables without execution.
- Evaluates code's suitability, design relevance, missing functionality, error handling, etc.
- Human-driven process for identifying defects early.

**Static Testing by Humans**
- Humans read code to detect errors.
- Merits: Human perspective, comparisons with design/specifications, multiple perspectives, saving computer resources.
- Multiple methods: Desk checking, code walkthrough, code review, code inspection.

**Desk Checking of the Code**
- Verify portions of code for correctness.
- Compare code with design or specifications.
- Effective for correcting "obvious" coding errors.
- Programmer's understanding of requirements could lead to errors.

**Code Walkthrough and Code Review**
- Walkthroughs are less formal than inspections.
- Walkthroughs involve a group looking at the code, asking questions, author explaining logic.
- Formal inspections (e.g., Fagan inspection) focus on detecting faults and violations.
- Inspection roles: Author, Moderator, Inspectors, Scribe.

**Combining Methods in Static Testing**
- Formal inspections can be time-consuming.
- Divide code parts based on criticality for formal inspections.
- Different methods used not only for code but also for other project deliverables.

**Static Analysis Tools**
- Automated tools for code analysis.
- Identify issues like unreachable code, unused variables, type casting problems, etc.
- Check compliance with coding standards and guidelines.

**Code Review Checklist: Categories**
- Data Item Declaration Related: Variable names, initialization, header files.
- Data Usage Related: Data types, data access, pointers, array bounds.
- Control Flow Related: Conditional paths, switch-case, loops, nesting.
- Standards and Style Related: Coding conventions, readability, machine-specific issues.
- Miscellaneous: Memory leaks, documentation, interfaces.

**Conclusion**
The provided content covers the aspects of white box testing, dynamic testing, static testing, and various methods of static testing by humans. It explains desk checking, code walkthroughs, code reviews, and code inspections. It also discusses the use of static analysis tools and code review checklists to ensure code quality and reliability. Remember to review and understand these concepts to perform well in your exam.
