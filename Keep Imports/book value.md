Book value denotes the residual value of the company if it were to sell all its assets and pay liabilities. Meaning, book value helps you determine the total amount the shareholders would receive if the company shuts its doors.

For example, a company issued shares worth 10 lakh, at ₹10 face value, and the company’s equity capital stands at ₹1 crore — face value (Rs 10) * outstanding shares (10 lakh). 
And it has total assets of ₹20 crore and total liabilities worth ₹5 crore. 
To calculate a company’s book value, we need to take the aggregate value of all its assets and deduct all the liabilities from it. i.e. 20 crore – 5 crore.

So, ₹15 crore will be the company’s book value. If you divide it with the outstanding shares (10 lakhs), you get the book value per share, which is ₹150. 

So when the company shuts down, shareholders will get Rs. 150 per share


BOOK VALUE OF DIVIDEND
Similarly, when companies announce a dividend, it is issued against the face value rather than the market price. If a company with a face value of ₹10 and a market price of ₹1000 announces a dividend of 100 percent of the face value, it means a dividend of ₹20 per share.
