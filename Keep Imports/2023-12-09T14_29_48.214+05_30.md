Static - without create a object call
It's not a constructor

Static int y=12

Static fun vs constructors





Inheritance - super()
Class Hyundai extends car{ }


Abstract class method is also a normal class it have also print method in that we must override all it's like a contract





Oops


1. Polymorphism - extends , override
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Encapsulation - private, public, _name;



Mixin jump { any methods }
Mixin ju{ }

Class animal With jump,ju,{ 



}
It's like extends? No it's not like that 


Code reuse,mixed with multiple class,no constructor

In inheritance strict is a relationship 


Mixin class also
 But no mixin class is mixin











As

Implement - @override

Class three extends one implement two ( both are must different class)

.start with()
? "Wow": " no" ;


Switch(varname)
Case "hi" or 1 :
Print ("jdh")
