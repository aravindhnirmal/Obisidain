Static Random Access Memory (SRAM): Data is stored in transistors and requires a constant power flow. Because of the continuous power, SRAM doesnâ€™t need to be refreshed to remember the data being stored. SRAM is called static as no change or action i.e. refreshing is not needed to keep the data intact. It is used in cache memories. 
Advantage: Low power consumption and faster access speeds. 
Disadvantage: Less memory capacities and high costs of manufacturing. 

2. Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM): Data is stored in capacitors. Capacitors that store data in DRAM gradually discharge energy, no energy means the data has been lost. So, a periodic refresh of power is required in order to function. DRAM is called dynamic as constant change or action i.e. refreshing is needed to keep the data intact. It is used to implement main memory. 

Advantage: Low costs of manufacturing and greater memory capacities. 
Disadvantage: Slow access speed and high power consumptio
