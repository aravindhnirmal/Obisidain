VANET stands for Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network. It's a type of wireless communication network where vehicles, like cars, communicate with each other and with roadside infrastructure. VANETs are crucial for applications like intelligent transportation systems, emergency response, and traffic management. They enable vehicles to share information about road conditions, traffic incidents, and safety warnings in real-time.


 topology-based, which means it makes routing decisions based on the physical positions and connectivity of vehicles within the network


 routing protocol on the Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) algorithm, which is well-suited for VANETs. GPSR uses a "greedy" strategy, where each vehicle forwards packets to the neighbor physically closest to the destination within its transmission range


If greedy forwarding isn't possible due to obstacles or gaps in the network, GPSR switches to "perimeter mode," where packets are routed around the network's perimeter until they can resume greedy forwarding. This approach minimizes the distance traveled by packets and ensures efficient data transmission.

We plan to create simulation models that mimic real-world VANET scenarios, including varying traffic densities and mobility patterns. This will allow us to thoroughly test and evaluate the protocol's performance and efficiency under different conditions.


 integrating it with emerging technologies like 5G networks and autonomous vehicles. We also aim to explore the possibility of real-world deployment and testing to validate our findings in practical VANET environments.

"I'd like to explain our proposed VANET routing protocol framework, which is designed to enhance data forwarding efficiency in vehicular networks. The framework consists of three key components: Greedy Forwarding, Mid-Area Calculation, and Distance and Direction.
This framework is particularly valuable in urban VANETs where traffic density varies significantly. It ensures that data is efficiently routed even in congested traffic conditions."

In comparison to traditional routing protocols, our approach minimizes link failures and reduces packet loss by intelligently considering distance and direction."


Certainly, let's break down some additional technical details for your conversation during the interview:

**Interviewer**: Can you elaborate on the specific mechanisms used in the GPSR-based routing protocol for VANETs?

**You**: Of course. In our protocol, we implement three key mechanisms:

1. **Greedy Forwarding**: Initially, the source node selects the neighbor node closest to the destination node as the next forwarder. This is based on a "greedy" choice, prioritizing the shortest path.

2. **Mid-Area Calculation**: To ensure efficient data forwarding, we introduce the concept of Mid-Area nodes. These nodes are strategically chosen to balance the trade-off between proximity and link stability. Vehicles in the Border-Area are more likely to exit the sender's transmission range, while those too close to the source face a higher risk of link failure due to signal attenuation.

3. **Distance and Direction**: We take into account the distance between nodes. Selecting nodes that are too close may lead to increased hop count and higher link failure chances due to signal attenuation. Conversely, opting for nodes that are too far may result in packet loss and delays. This mechanism helps strike a balance.

**Interviewer**: Could you explain how the GPSR protocol addresses situations where Greedy Forwarding may fail?

**You**: Certainly, Greedy Forwarding can fail when there are no neighboring nodes nearer to the destination than the source node. In such cases, we apply the "Right-Hand Rule." When arriving at a node, the packet is forwarded to its first counterclockwise neighbor. This rule helps avoid the failure of Greedy Forwarding and maintains packet flow.

**Interviewer**: How do you calculate the Mid-Area nodes precisely?

**You**: To calculate Mid-Area nodes, we utilize geometry. We consider the geometry of the Border Area and subtract it from the geometry of the entire Sector. The result is the Mid-Area. By applying mathematical formulas derived from geometry, we can accurately determine which nodes fall into the Mid-Area category.

**Interviewer**: You mentioned future work involving spatial considerations. Could you provide more details on this?

**You**: Certainly, one direction for future work involves factoring in the unique challenges posed by specific spatial scenarios, such as bridges and subways. In these environments, signal propagation behaves differently due to obstacles and reflections. We plan to develop routing strategies tailored to address these scenarios effectively, potentially involving different node selection criteria and path prediction algorithms.

**Interviewer**: What about incorporating link quality metrics? How does that fit into your future work?

**You**: Link quality metrics are crucial for assessing the reliability of communication links between nodes. In future research, we aim to integrate metrics such as signal strength, interference levels, and channel conditions into our routing protocol. This will enable more informed decisions on node selection, leading to improved packet delivery rates and reduced data loss, especially in scenarios with varying signal quality.

These technical details illustrate the depth of our work and our commitment to optimizing VANET communication.
