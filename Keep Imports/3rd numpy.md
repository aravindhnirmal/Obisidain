Arrays: Understanding how to create, manipulate, and access arrays is fundamental to using NumPy for machine learning.

Indexing and slicing: Being able to select and modify specific elements or sub-arrays of an array is important for processing data.

Broadcasting: Broadcasting is a powerful feature of NumPy that allows arrays with different shapes to be used in operations together.

Mathematical functions: NumPy provides many mathematical functions that are useful for data preprocessing and analysis, such as mean, standard deviation, and correlation.

Linear algebra: NumPy provides a wide range of functions for linear algebra operations, including matrix multiplication, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, and singular value decomposition (SVD).

Random number generation: Random number generation is an important feature for many machine learning algorithms, and NumPy provides several functions for generating random numbers and random arrays.

Masking and boolean indexing: Masking and boolean indexing are useful techniques for filtering and selecting data based on certain criteria.

File input/output: NumPy provides functions for reading and writing data to and from files in various formats, including text and binary files.
