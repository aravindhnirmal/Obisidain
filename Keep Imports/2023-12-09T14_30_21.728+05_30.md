mulitasking 
process based two programs same concureently 
thread based -in one program task concuretnly(light wieght) same address space cheaper 
runnin ,ready torun ,susupended,resumed ,blocked

2 ways 
threads class 
runnable interface

concurrency -one time many proceess
concurrent software

mulititasking -multiprocess


threads-oru process kula many task at same time(subset of multiprocessing)

stack in fifo
catch e.printStackTrace()
single stack

videogames, cartoon,one app la concurrency ya webservers


single thread -doing only one task(job)
 object class


thread -simultaneously calling parallel running



multithreading by
1. extending thread class
2.or by implementing runnable interface


extends threads class  la run method( ) ,start() 



mulitasking -several acvities  to occur concureently 
1. process based -movie and gooogleing
2. thread based-ms word la auto correction varuthu la type on screen and same in autocoreection within program intself

one single program with multitasking

main is thread
thread vs process
threads -||el share the same address space and switch is easy less costly 
why ?
single thread environment only one task at a time can be performed
