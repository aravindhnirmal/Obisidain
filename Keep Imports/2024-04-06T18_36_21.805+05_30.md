Are u the parents of ur infrastructure?
In it right policy and rights to the infrastructure
Like a kitchen to avoid the blasters



Security in kubernetes 
1. Role based access ctrl
2. Nw policy
3. Encryption data in transmit using mTls, network and infrastructure layer 
4. Vulnerability and iac (infrastructure as code ) scanning


Benefits of security 
Ctrl the end user access over the cluster or infrastructure
Avoid security threats
Established the standards practice
Have the optimising resources and how to use and how much to use




Kyverno a policy engine 

Generate a dynamic admission ctroller - validation 
Create policy as kubernetes resources
Allow to validate ,mutate generate resources

Allow to verify the image , 

Test the policy also



Scan the image  with the kyverno


Trivy a vulnerability scanner

@Hoppscotch

Open hardware

Soc and chip and Arduino is cost (but not technically Foss)


3d printers open source


Having it 




Hardware community is not good for India and its small


Electronics 101 class 


mcu 


Just in the iot  in 

wokwi

Corydora 

Qmk compatible rp2040  3x3 note pad (keyboard)



Cading more than programming 


Qmk for os keyboard
For atmel avr and arm usb families



Rp2040 zero small chip 


Kicad for Foss hardware designing


Not a pcb designer in India and in china jcb 
More import tax in India


Fusion 360 


Slicer prusa slicer software





Hotspot keyboard remove the button and fix any buttons

Mechanical keyboard is beautiful


Join absurd industry   for hardware Discord sever balub github,gobo.in for 3d printing
