Net turnover is a value that can express a number of different figures in business. A company may use net turnover to measure the total volume of sales as well as the influx of new employees. In business accounting, net turnover is the measure of annual sales volume minus all costs, including state sales tax and discounts. The resulting figure represents how much net profit a business brings in from the sale of its goods and services.
"profit" term can refer to gross profit, rather than net profit. The calculation of gross profit does not include any selling, general, and administrative expenses, and so is less revealing than net profit
