- [ ]  LR because it's a fundamental algorithm for binary classification problems. It's easy to implement and interpret, making it an excellent choice for providing baseline results
- [ ] KNN is a non-parametric algorithm that can capture complex decision boundaries. 
- [ ] potential non-linearity in the data. By tuning the 'k' value, we could adapt the model's sensitivity to local patterns in the data.  for interrealted facts in medicine
