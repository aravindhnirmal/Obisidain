The equal sign (=) is used to assign a value to a variable.

>>> # 3 times 'un', followed by 'ium'
>>> 3 * 'un' + 'ium'
'unununium'

>>> word = 'Python'
>>> word[0] # character in position 0
'P'

Indices may also be negative numbers, to start counting from the right
>>> word[-1] # last character
'n'
>>> word[0:2] # characters from position 0 (included) to 2 (excluded)
'Py'

The body of the loop is indented:


An if … elif … elif … sequence is a substitute for the
switch or case statements found in other languages


range(10) generates 10 values, the legal indices
for items of a sequence of length 10. 




range(5, 10)
5, 6, 7, 8, 9
range(0, 10, 3)
0, 3, 6, 9
