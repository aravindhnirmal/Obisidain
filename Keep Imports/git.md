Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide to resolving the issue and pushing your local branch `newfeatures2` to the remote repository:

1. Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:
   ```
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. Switch to your `newfeatures2` branch:
   ```
   git checkout newfeatures2
   ```

3. Merge the remote changes into your local branch:
   ```
   git merge origin/newfeatures2
   ```

4. Resolve any conflicts that may arise during the merge. Open the conflicting files, resolve the conflicts, and save the changes.

5. Commit the merge changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "Merge remote changes into newfeatures2"
   ```

6. Push your local branch to the remote repository:
   ```
   git push origin newfeatures2
   ```

Make sure to carefully follow each step in the given order. If you encounter any conflicts during the merge, resolve them before committing and pushing the changes.


if the github have the readme first u pull next push 

"fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories" typically occurs when you are trying to merge two branches that have diverged and do not share a common commit history.
git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
git remote add origin link 
git push
