Money comes the Business came



Put money ,goto market ,take the profit - business layout 


Any demand has been  that business come 
But now Create the demand 
Find the pain point to create the business


Business is to make profit  but it have the grey area 



Business structure is must to be reform 


I run business to make profit - intense is to make money  not to give the solution

Find a pain  point is the main point to start a business 


Whether I function to run the business to make profit ( idea)
Or 
To make the profit through to run my business 
It have the grey area 

Is any actually a seen demand or the demand created (dark area) with complex eg dapawala vs swiggy




Product demand meets win win
