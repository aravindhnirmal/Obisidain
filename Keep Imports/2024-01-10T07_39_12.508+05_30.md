‚åõ ‚è≥Learn Complexities
How can you tell if a program you wrote is efficient or not?

Yes, this is measured in terms of complexities üëá

‚è∞ Time Complexity:-

It measures code execution time.

Time Complexity shows how optimized your code is, which makes your code better and makes the code to run fast.

üìÅ Space Complexity:-

It is the amount of space needed to run code.

Space Complexity also makes your code more optimized.

‚≠ê Following is the list of the three most common asymptotic notation that are used to represent the time complexity of algorithm üëá

O Big O Notation: It describes worst-case scenarios

Œ© Omega Notation: It describes Best-case scenarios

Œò Theta Notation: It describes Average complexity of an algorithm
