When the interest rates is increased the investors are expected the market atleast more than interest  rates
Ex :FD is 8% ,the market should give the atleast 13% , because it's risky 
When the rbi deceased the interest rates of investor(FD) ,the market is jolly thaan the market is high  

If the fed interest rate is increased the indian market is decreased because the fij are selling their stocks for their better return(selling pressure)
