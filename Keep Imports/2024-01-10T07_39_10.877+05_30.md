Arrays: Arrays are a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. They are used for quick access to data elements and are the most basic data structure.

Linked Lists: Linked lists are a collection of nodes, each containing a data element and a pointer to the next node. They are used for dynamic memory allocation and can be used to implement stacks and queues.

Stacks: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements can be inserted and deleted only from one end called the top of the stack.

Queues: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements can be inserted at the rear end and deleted from the front end of the queue.

Trees: Trees are non-linear data structures that are used to represent hierarchical relationships between elements. Some common types of trees include binary trees, AVL trees, and red-black trees.

Graphs: Graphs are non-linear data structures that are used to represent relationships between elements. They are used in many applications such as social networks, transportation networks, and computer networks.

Hash Tables: A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to values. It provides constant-time average-case access to data elements and is used in many applications such as databases and caches.
