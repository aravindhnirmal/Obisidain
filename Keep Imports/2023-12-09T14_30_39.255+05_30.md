requirement engineering
1. helps software enginieering to better understand the prblem to solve
encompasses set of ques:
1. what is the business impact of the software
2.what customer wants
3.how end users will interact with software

broad spectrum of task and techniqques that leads to understanding of requirements -reqiuirement engineering

processes used to discover ,analyse and validate system requirementd -RE PROCESS

it begins during communication activity and continues into modeling activity

RE tasks
Inception—Establish a basic understanding of the problem 
and the nature of the solution.
§ Elicitation—Draw out the requirements from stakeholders.
§ Elaboration—Create an analysis model that represents 
information, functional, and behavioral aspects of the 
requirements.
§ Negotiation —Agree on a deliverable system that is realistic 
for developers and customers.
§ Specification—Describe the requirements formally or 
informally.
§ Validation—Review the requirement specification for errors,
ambiguities, omissions, and conflicts.
§ Requirements management—Manage changing 
requirements
Inception: This involves identifying the business goals and objectives for the project and determining whether it is feasible and viable to pursue the project.

Elicitation: This involves gathering and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements of the system from stakeholders. This can be achieved through interviews, workshops, surveys, and other techniques.

Elaboration: This involves refining the requirements and adding more detail to them. It includes analyzing, prioritizing, and organizing the requirements to ensure they are clear, concise, and unambiguous.

Negotiation: This involves reconciling conflicting requirements from different stakeholders and arriving at a consensus. It requires effective communication, problem-solving, and decision-making skills.

Specification: This involves documenting the requirements in a formal and structured manner using techniques such as use cases, user stories, and requirements documents. The specifications should be clear, complete, and consistent.

Validation: This involves verifying that the requirements are correct, complete, and meet the needs of the stakeholders. It involves techniques such as reviews, inspections, testing, and prototyping.

Requirement management: This involves tracking changes to the requirements, ensuring that they are properly documented, and communicating the changes to stakeholders. It also involves managing traceability between the requirements and other artifacts in the software development lifecycle.
