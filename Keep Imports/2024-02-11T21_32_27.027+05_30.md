[[Keep/Colour/DEFAULT]] 

Cover as significant amount of syllabus as possible, but keep atleast 20-30 days for just revision at end. If you have covered the subjects, solving last 15 years papers is a great strategy. In last week keep a clock, set 3 hours alarm and solve the last 5 years papers, a day each.


Solve previous 30 years question papers, solve them twice if you can. Solve test series online, Eg Ace, madeeasy, etc. As pointed out by others, try to complete the syllabus at least a month before

.Every year gate releases syllabus. See the syllabus and then take 1 good book of each subject and learn the topics provided in the syllabus. Then buy good coaching material and read it. Coaching institute knows what topics are important( generally they also match their book topics with the Gate syllabus). And solve questions from coaching material. Solve past 25 years gate exam paper. Then buy atleast 2 test series of atleast 100 tests each and complete it. Give chapter test once u finish any topic/ chapter. Solving questions is the key. Solve as many as possible but be within gate syllabus.(if u seek good coaching material then u need not to worry about that).and maths is very important. Coaching institutes generally provides good book for maths, which is sufficient.
