Here's a simple CUDA program to perform a linear search on an array:

```cpp
[[include]] <iostream>
[[include]] <cuda_runtime.h>

[[define]] N 1024

__global__ void linearSearch(int* array, int target, int* result) {
    int tid = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;

    if (tid < N) {
        if (array[tid] == target) {
            *result = tid;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int array[N];
    int target = 42;
    int result = -1;  // Initialize result to -1 (not found)

    // Initialize the array with data
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        array[i] = i * 2;
    }

    int* d_array;
    int* d_result;

    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_array, N * sizeof(int));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_result, sizeof(int));

    cudaMemcpy(d_array, array, N * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_result, &result, sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

    linearSearch<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_array, target, d_result);

    cudaMemcpy(&result, d_result, sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    cudaFree(d_array);
    cudaFree(d_result);

    if (result != -1) {
        std==cout << "Target " << target << " found at index " << result << std==endl;
    } else {
        std==cout << "Target " << target << " not found in the array." << std==endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this CUDA program:

1. The `linearSearch` kernel is responsible for searching for the target element in the array.

2. The array is initialized with some data, and the target value is set to 42 as an example.

3. Device memory is allocated for the array and result.

4. Data is copied from the host to the device.

5. The kernel is configured and launched with appropriate block and grid dimensions.

6. The result is copied from the device to the host.

7. Finally, the program checks if the target was found or not and prints the result accordingly.
