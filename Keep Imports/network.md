segment send to receice
sedning side-encpasulates into datagrams
on rceiving side segments toupperlayer
it has in every host and router

two functions
forwarding-from i/o to o/p move packets from routers
routing-determine the route 
both r deeply releteable
internet example for this

arch . of routing
run routing algorithm 
forwarding algorithm from inocming to outgoing link
4 parts
1. router i/p ports
2.             o/p
3. routing processor
4. high speed switching fabric

in input port function
line termination,link layer protocol,queeing (datagram destination 

switching fabrics
transfer pckt input to output buffer
rate at which packets can be transfer form input to o/p
three type sof switching fabrics 1.memory,2.bus,3.crossbsr
