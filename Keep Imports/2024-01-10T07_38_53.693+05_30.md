Arrays: a collection of elements of the same type that are stored in contiguous memory locations.

Linked Lists: a collection of nodes where each node points to the next node 
in the list.

Stacks: a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

Queues: a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

Trees: a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.

Graphs: a collection of nodes and edges that can be used to represent relationships between objects.

Hash Tables: a data structure that stores key-value pairs and provides constant-time access to values based on their keys.

Heaps: a data structure that maintains a partial order of its elements, often used for implementing priority queues

Sets: a collection of unique elements, where the order of the elements may not be important.

Maps: a data structure that stores key-value pairs, where each key is unique and can be used to access the corresponding value efficiently.

Tries: a tree-like data structure that is often used for efficient string searching.

Bloom Filters: a probabilistic data structure that can efficiently test whether an element is a member of a set, with a small chance of false positives.

Skip Lists: a probabilistic data structure that provides efficient search, insertion, and deletion of elements, often used in place of balanced trees.

Red-Black Trees: a type of self-balancing binary search tree that guarantees O(log n) worst-case time complexity for many operations.
