I successfully developed a topology-based routing protocol for Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs), enhancing communication between vehicles in dynamic conditions. Through extensive simulations, the protocol exhibited improved performance over traditional methods, contributing to more reliable and low-latency communication, thereby enhancing smart transportation systems.

Additionally, I led a project in machine learning for heart disease prediction. Using advanced algorithms, we achieved a high accuracy rate in detecting potential heart diseases. This project facilitated early detection and personalized treatment planning, and I collaborated effectively with a diverse team to seamlessly integrate the solution into the healthcare environment, ensuring practical applicability.
