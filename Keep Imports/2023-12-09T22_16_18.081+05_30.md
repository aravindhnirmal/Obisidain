[[Keep/Colour/DEFAULT]] 

Keys to happiness and success
Munger: Just avoid things like racing trains to the crossing, doing cocaine, etc. Develop good mental habits. And avoid evil, particularly if they're attractive members of the opposite sex.

Buffett: Look at the people you like to hang out with. What qualities do you like about them? Why don't you copy them? And look at the people you don't like. What don't you like about them, and can you stop doing these things?

Munger: If your new behavior gives you a little temporary unpopularity with your peer group, then the hell with them.

Buffett: This reminds me of the old lady who was asked what she liked about being 103 years old. She replied, "No peer pressure."
