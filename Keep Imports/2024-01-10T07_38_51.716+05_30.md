Stand-alone systems that are marketed and sold to any customer who wishes to buy them


Generic products
Stand-alone systems that are marketed and sold to any customer who wishes to buy them.
Examples – PC software such as editing, graphics programs, project management tools; CAD software; software for specific markets such as appointments systems in hospitals.
Customized products
Software that is commissioned by a specific customer to meet their own needs. 
Examples – embedded control systems, air traffic control software, traffic monitoring systems.


The costs of software on a PC are often greater than the hardware cost

more to maintain 


Software is developed or engineered, it is not manufactured in the classical sense which has quality problem
Software doesn't "wear out.” but it deteriorates (due to change)
Hardware has bathtub curve of failure rate ( high failure rate in the beginning, then drop to steady state, then cumulative effects of dust, vibration, abuse occurs). 

different domain:
system software-compiler,editors,file  maagement utilities
app sofwate-stand-alone programs for specific needs
Engineering/scientific software: Characterized by “number crunching”algorithms. such as automotive stress analysis, molecular biology, orbital dynamics etc
mbedded software bide within a product or system
Product-line software focus on a limited marketplace to address mass consumer market. 
 WebApps (Web applications) network centric software
AI software uses non-numerical algorithm to solve complex problem


Software Engineering: (1) The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.produce reliable and trustworthy systems economically and quickly.
It is usually cheaper, in the long run, to use software engineering methods and techniques for software systems rather than just write the programs as if it was a personal programming project. 


 What are the attributes of good software?
Good software should deliver the required functionality and performance to the user and should be maintainable, dependable and usable.

Computer science focuses on theory and fundamentals; software engineering is concerned with the practicalities of developing and delivering useful software.



Layered technology
QUALITY
PROCESS
METHODS
TOOLS

QUALITY-ANY engineereing approach must br rest on organzational commitment quality work rely on and foster a continoius process improement culture
PROCESS- foundatiom layers defines  a framework with activities for felivery a quality and efffective software engineering technology.establish the context where products model,data,report and forms are produced,milestone are
established and quality is ensured
METHOD: provides techincal HOW tod for building software tasks include the communication ,reqiurement analysis ,design modeling and testing and supporting
TOOLS:
provide automated or semi automated support for the process and methods


FRAMEWORK ACTIVITIES:( this is for mini project ,mini ppl)
CPMCD
1. COMMUNICATION-communicae with customer what their objectivea and gather requirment
2. PLANNING-create a map defines the work by describing  the tasks ,risks and resources and work product and schedule.
3. MODELING-create a sketch,and analysis of requirement,how constituent parts fit together  and design
4. CONSTRUCTION- code generaion and testing
5. DEPLOYMENT-delivery to the customer who evalidites the product
