[[Keep/Colour/DEFAULT]] 

I took the sweet parts of me and slathered them upon your rotten heart.  I touched the dark parts of you with the lightness and gentleness of my finger.  And when you didn’t change, when you didn’t bring your guard down, I gave you more.  I poured and poured and poured all the love I had into your body, into your soul, until I had nothing left.  My heart empty, my eyes tired.

 

I lost myself while loving you.








That’s the problem, I am a tree and you are a flower, easily swept away by the winds of someone better.
