Data Cleaning
• Data in the Real World Is Dirty:
• Missing data may be due to
• equipment malfunction
• inconsistent with other recorded data and thus deleted
• data not entered due to misunderstanding
• certain data may not be considered important at the time of entry
• not register history or changes of the data

How to Handle Missing Data?
• Ignore the tuple
• Fill in the missing value manually
• Use a global constant to fill in the missing value
• Use a measure of central tendency for the attribute (e.g., the mean or median) to 
fill in the missing value
• Use the attribute mean or median for all samples belonging to the same class as 
the given tuple
• Use the most probable value to fill in the missing value



How to Handle Noisy Data
• Binning
• first sort data and partition into (equal-frequency) bins
• then one can smooth by bin means, smooth by bin median, smooth by bin
boundaries, etc.
• Regression
• smooth by fitting the data into regression functions; Linear regression, Multilinear regression
 Clustering
• detect and remove outliers
• Combined computer and human inspection
• detect suspicious values and check by human



Data Integration






Redundant attributes may be able to be detected by correlation analysis and
covariance analysis
• Careful integration of the data from multiple sources may help reduce/avoid 
redundancies a
