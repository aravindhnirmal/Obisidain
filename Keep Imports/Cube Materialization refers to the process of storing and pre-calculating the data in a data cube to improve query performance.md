Slice: The slice operation selects a subset of the data cube by fixing one or more dimensions to a specific value. For example, if we have a data cube containing sales data with dimensions like time, product, region, and salesperson, we can slice the cube by fixing the time dimension to a specific date to view sales for that date only.

Dice: The dice operation selects a subset of the data cube by specifying a range of values for one or more dimensions. For example, we can dice the sales cube by selecting sales for a particular range of time, products, and regions.

Roll-up: The roll-up operation aggregates data across one or more dimensions of the data cube. For example, we can roll-up the sales data from a daily to a monthly level by aggregating the daily sales figures for each month.

Drill-down: The drill-down operation provides a way to view detailed information about a specific cell in the data cube by breaking down the cell into its component parts. For example, we can drill-down on the sales data for a specific region to view the sales data by each salesperson in that region.

Pivot: The pivot operation allows users to reorganize the data cube by changing the position of dimensions. For example, we can pivot the sales cube by swapping the positions of the region and product dimensions to view sales by product for each region.

OLAP operations enable users to extract valuable insights from large volumes of data stored in a data warehouse. These operations allow users to analyze data from different perspectives, drill down to the lowest level of detail, and perform complex calculations to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data.
