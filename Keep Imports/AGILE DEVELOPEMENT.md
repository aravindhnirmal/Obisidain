Agile =  iteration + increment process model
flexiable like wet clay
others are classical perspective model ,healthy software developing for each individual person ,old  is many documentations
response to change ,effective communication for all teams memebers ,eliminate us and them attitude ,plan must be flex,keeep them lean change will be not change 
whole process is customer involved and change is always welcome and 
rapid ,incremental delivery of software,not appilable for all product quick changes that  bases of business change and also software must change
 change is the primary driver of agility

WHY ITSIMPORTANT-world fast paced ,to deliver succesful system quickly and effectly
basic activiites is same as cpmcd
cost of change increases non linerary as a project 
development schedule progress increases as development cost increases but not in agile process.A well-designed agile process may “flatten” the cost of change curve by coupling incremental delivery with agile practices such as continuous unit testing and pair programming. Thus team can accommodate changes late in the software project without dramatic cost and time impact


process:
what is require atke some assumptions in my heart,recoginzes the plan in short lived ,customer prioirt si change
deveolps software iteratively with emphasis on constrution activities
have a adapt to change


12 agile prininciple:
1. high proirty to satisfy hte customer  on continous manner





many models 
1. XP(extreme programming) :
Planning is first -listening to customers,gather information from their csutomer give their priorty"users stories"
story are divided into priority ,low ,riskist is implemented first
 Designing:
kis priniciple,its provide implementation guidance for a story
xp is use of design CRC cards only one design product
its encourage also refactoring(design occurs continuosly as the system is constructed
Coding: unit test is occurs pair programming occurs and quailty checks by other person
Testing: unit test will be automated,regression testing strategy

IXP(industrial XP): prganoc evolution of xp
its for management for also,every is on board stakeholders,deveoplers,managements..,

6 new practices:
1. readiness statement: organiazation should be a distinct quality program and contiunous improvement,culture will support the new values of agile team
2. in XP people are called team an in this IXPchange into commmunity adn it have well trained technologist and customers who r suucessful to project
3. project chartering :the overall goals and objectives of the organization.
4. test driven management: measurable criteria adn state of project is on progress
5. retrospective-issues ,events and lessons learned 
6. continous learnning
