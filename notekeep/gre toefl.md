Hello everyone! I got my results today and i scored 110/120. I'm overall happy but i could do better in certain aspects, i don't think i'll take it again anytime soon but i want to thank everyone here on reddit for being so helpful and kind.

My scores: R 28, L 26, S29, W 27.

**Reading 28**

Actually i've always been good at reading although i did find TOEFL readings challenging to say the least. I read about 30 books a year and half of them are most likely in English and the other half in my native language. The way i approached reading is with [Cracking the TOEFL iBT 2019 edition](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-TOEFL-iBT-Audio-2019/dp/0525567887). Thinking back i really wouldn't buy it again if you'll buy a book or get it online i **highly recommend** [Official Guide to the Toefl Test](https://www.amazon.com/Official-Guide-TOEFL-CD-ROM-Toefl/dp/0071766588). I did all the reading sections in this book and that helped me a lot, since they are previous past tests.

_Some things to keep in mind:_

-never answer questions from memory or bc you think they make sense, everything is stated in the reading so pay careful attention.

- avoid answers that are too extreme (contain never, always..)

- expand your vocab bc the right answers just contain synonyms of the words in the text

- pay attention to your timing!!

I actually got 4 texts and i had about 1 h and 7 min, i spent almost 47 min with my first 2 texts and i had only 20 min to answer 20 questions in the remining 2 texts. It was awful and very stressful please be careful. Another rlly helpful and free material is this :[the only youtube reading video you'll need!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69-viuqAW58), this guy goes over every kind of question in a text and explains with detail everything so check it out.

This is what worked for me i hope it does for you too :)!

**Listening 26**

This is the part im most disappointed with unfortunately and i don't feel like i can give much advice in this section since my score wasn't anything special. I really didn't do anything apart from the general [ets practise test](https://www.ets.org/s/toefl/free-practice/start.html) which is fundamentally essential for everyone. **I actually recommend you do it after you have a general idea of every section in the TOEFL and after you have familiarised yourself with every question.**

I watch a lot of tv shows and movies and therefore i thought i'd just go with the flow, after taking some practise test in [toeflbank](https://www.toeflbank.com/en) listening was always my strong point, i found it very easy so didn't study at all for it. I think bc i got 4 texts and i thought i didn't do my best it kind of affected my listening score as well i was very upset. **Important*** _pls don't take TOEFL bank's score too srsly, it's true they give you a rough idea of your score but it doesn't necessarily mean that will be your official score. Believe in yourself and be focused. I strongly believe it is a great web for practise and i used it a lot when preparing but my score was higher than what i usually got in toefl bank._

**Speaking 29**

I'm going to be honest here i was so scared of the speaking section and i actually did best here xd. ironic isn't it.. As for what i used, first study some templates!! You don't have to use them in your test day i didn't, but if your speaking is rlly bad at the beginning they can srsly help you out. Personally i found his templates the best [toefl speaking template](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_tuHAUyB4w&list=PLOLkS2kLE0FaxdOpF9WIi1tIzXq2IUqG8). Again you can experiment and find what suits you best. Also i used other practise questions to get the hang of it : [90 practise questions!](https://bettertoeflscores.com/toefl-speaking-task-1-strategy/12418/) and [practise questions with answers :)](https://www.toeflresources.com/speaking-section/toefl-speaking-samples/) . Pls set a timer and don't just speak as long as you wish, you need to get used to the time limit bc it's rlly short ;/.

**Writing 27**

Actually i expected more here but we'll make do with what we have. I used [2020 Guide to the TOEFL Integrated Essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RP01I8xvn4&ab_channel=TOEFLResources) which is rlly helpful i swear, take the time to study it and fully understand it. You don't have to use the exact same words with him but just get an idea on how to structure your essay. As for the independent essay i go with the flow but if you need smth just check this out [essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqQcEBb9Zf0&t=1479s&ab_channel=TOEFLResources) . As for samples i used this [practise questions writing](https://www.toeflresources.com/sample-toefl-essays/).

Btw i took the toefl ibt home edition and my proctor was very polite and calm, we didn't have any problems even though i forgot my window open and there were a lot of noise which distracted me in the reading and listening section :(. I studied for a week but my English has always been relatively good since i read a lot of books, however don't panic, toefl is mostly abt understanding and using strategies. I hope that everyone will get their dream score, good luck everyone!! Feel free to ask any questions you have.

Nest stop SAT wish me luck >.<

Replying because I feel like comments here might be overcomplicating this. I understand you can feel dazed and confused when just starting preparation for something new. But since you are preparing for GRE and have a good grasp of English, you already have very little to worry about. I was in the same position as you a couple of months ago (GRE prep + good English) and scored a 111 on TOEFL (R: 24; L: 27; S: 30; W: 30) after preparing for 5 days, so 11 is more than plenty.

To start off, the comment on [this quora post](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-prepare-for-TOEFL-in-1-week) by Arnab Datta sums up how you should approach the exam pretty well. Here's my advice for each section:

**Reading**: Skim through the passage as fast as you can. Most questions are para based so you don't need to go into intricate details in your first reading, just get the gist of the whole passage so you're able to answer overarching questions that come in the end. This shouldn't be a problem if you've already prepared for GRE RCs. My score was lowest in reading because honestly I got a bit overconfident because my GRE RCs were going well, and I was scoring 10/11 easy on the practice TOEFL tests, so I got complacent and didn't do more. So practice, practice, practice. 10-15 official TOEFL reading comprehensions should be plenty though.

**Listening**: Taking notes (and the _right_ notes) is key. Here's my personal experience though (this might work for you or not) - it's more important that you pay attention to everything that's been said rather than missing a few things because you were busy taking notes. The questions can happen to be about the minute thing you missed (happened to me). If you are quick at taking notes, go for it. If you find you're missing parts of what's being said because you were busy taking notes - try this: don't take notes at all. Just listen, and answer the questions by sheer memory. Don't underestimate the RAM capacity of your brain. Listen intently, and answer questions immediately. But be sure to try this out and not take my word for it (taking notes is still a pretty good strategy after all). Although I found out (during the exam itself, sadly) that I was able to answer questions better when I wasn't taking a lot of notes because I recalled everything that was said better. I'm confident that I didn't get a perfect score in Listening because during the first 2 passages I was too busy taking notes and missed a few points that unfortunately the questions were based on later. Try out both techniques and see what works best for you.

**Speaking**: Record yourself speaking out loud. It puts you on the spot and you'll get used to the pressure of speaking when it matters. Play it back and listen to where you're going wrong. Course correct accordingly. The most important thing here is to remember that you don't have to be perfect. Speak clearly, and on topic. Even if what comes to your mind feels like a stupid point, don't worry about it. Just speak _something_. As long as what you're talking about is relevant, you're good. GregMat's videos on speaking will clear all this up for you. I sincerely didn't expect to get a perfect score in Speaking, but I followed his advice and did two things right - I was very clear in my articulation, and I didn't deviate from the topic. So a) see GregMat's vids on speaking and b) record yourself speaking.

**Writing**: Follow GregMat's template. Period. If there was one thing I was sure about, it was that I would get a good writing score. I just followed Greg's advice word by word, and my score speaks for itself. You literally don't need to consult any other source.

Be sure to go through all the videos on ETS's official TOEFL portal where they walk you through the entire format. Every section also has sample examples and a few questions in pdf form at the bottom of the page. All of this is free so be sure to practice everything in every section that comes from the og source. Sample TOEFL questions from 3rd party sources are seldom reliable, so don't even bother. All you need for Speaking & Writing is GregMat. Don't waste your time anywhere else. I didn't see any YT videos on Reading or Listening - just practiced, but feel free to explore (maybe just see GregMat's videos on these as well). IMO you don't need any app or paid guidance to do well in TOEFL. You don't even need to buy their official TOEFL book tbh. The way you've written your question displays a command over the language, and since you've been preparing for GRE, you are already 70% ready. Just GregMat & practice, and I'm sure you'll get a 100+ score.

DM me if you would like to ask me anything or want the official TOEFL online book ;) All the best and do update what score you get!

TOEFL can be easily prepared in a week. I personally got 100 in TOEFL (R:23 L:26 W:27 S:24) after just 4-5 days of preparing. (BTW I am also from India). My TOEFL date was 4 Sept 2021

Since you might have taken the GRE, do not start studying for reading and writing. Start with the listening section first. Couple of reasons for that: you must get used to the listening once and remembering content and secondly listening will help you in integrated tasks in speaking and writing section.

So for listening, go to the ets TOEFL official website and on their website you can find additional 3-4 conversations with questions in a zip file. Try to answer the questions accordingly after listening. If you want additional practice , search on YouTube for TOEFL listening practice and I think there is a channel dedicated for listening practice

My main strategy for listening section was to listen to the conversation carefully and note only few points such that when I would go through the notes, I can recall the flow of the conversation or the lecture.

Next section you must practice is the speaking section. If you are done with the listening part, then it should feel a bit easy while practicing. For speaking , I refered to TST prep YouTube channel for their excellent templates. Just search for each speaking questions on their YouTube channel and watch their videos. Also they have made their videos recently, and hence no confusion regarding the change in the pattern

Personally, my TOEFL went absolutely horrible due to speaking section and I thought I would have to give it again. But somehow they went lenient on me and gave me good marks. I would advise you to isolate yourself in a room and practice each question and learn their template by heart. Record your voice and find ways to improve your speech. I would recommend to start by writing down the answer for the speech in the given format and then speak. Also prepare the format for the speech before the question starts

For the writing section, I again refered TST prep for their excellent templates. Make sure you learn their templates and use them in writing. My writing score is 27 and I solely give credit to their templates. Practice on 1-2 topics you can find on YouTube (writing question 1) and ets official website. The second question is just an opinion question which you must have practiced for awa section of GRE.

Reading section is much easier to answer compared to GRE, but the passage length is too much to read. My strategy was to read the 1st para and find what the passage is about. And then rush to the questions to solve them. The questions are structured such that while asking they refer to each para for eg. According to paragraph 3, what is ...... So I would read the question only and head to the paragraph to make sense of it and find the answer. As you can see , I did not get a great score in reading, but it is enough for me. Also time is a major enemy in the reading section

Lastly, I would recommend you to register on the TOEFL bank and give their test . First give the section wise test and then give the complete exam. Their premium is available for 24 hrs and you need to pay after 24 hrs or create a new account if you are not done in that time. Nice thing about TOEFL bank is that they give their scores after the exam. Even ETS TOEFL does not give scores of speaking and writing section

If you want more practice then go to the ets TOEFL and give their test. If you require practice even more, then search kmf TOEFL and register on it (Chinese version of the test with contents of the TOEFL premium. I would leave the issue of piracy and morality to you )

Lastly on the TOEFL exam, one more tip, register yourself a bit late after everyone goes in and starts their exam.

A few benefits from this :

1. everyone will start mic testing and if you are early then you may find disturbance in reading section.
    
2. When you are on speaking section, everyone will be on the writing section and you can speak without disturbance
    
3. When you are on the writing section, some of them may have left , others are busy writing, but no one is speaking, you may find most concentration here.
    

Hope you find this useful

That's a lot to unpack, but I guess I'll take a stab at it:

1. TSTPrep has the best and most accurate practice tests. You gotta pay for them, but I can provide a discount code if you send me a DM.
    
2. They are very, very helpful. I recommend them to everyone. But they should be combined with third party sources of strategies.
    
3. Here are some that I made: [speaking templates](https://www.toeflresources.com/speaking-section/toefl-speaking-templates/) and [writing templates](https://www.toeflresources.com/writing-section/toefl-writing-templates/).
    
4. Notefull is fine. But it is old and creaky. I feel like its content hasn't been sufficiently updated.
    
5. The test centers don't have consistent quality. Some are great. Some are not. Some are quiet. Some are loud. Perhaps mention the test center you have in mind.

I recently scored 730(Q50,V39) but I was always confused about which prep material is best for me and I'd always question whether or not it would take me to 700+. I ended up using trials of literally everything on the market and **purchased Magoosh, Target Test Prep (TTP), and E-GMAT (verbal)**.

# MAGOOSH

- Best for native speakers who are clear with their quant basics.
    
- Magoosh doesn't go deep when it comes to explaining concepts. As I am non native speaker, doing their verbal didn't help me much as I was never clear with even the most basic concepts.
    
- Magoosh quant is good for those who are clear with basics as it provides a sort of summary about quant concepts. However, if you aren't clear with basic algebra, arithmetic, geometry, etc, Magoosh will only be a waste of your time.
    
- For those looking to save money during prep, this is the course for you. One of the cheapest courses but the best in that price range. Nevertheless, I request that you get the best course and not settle for less if according to your needs, you need some costly course. You are going to spend a ton of money on applications and tuition fee so saving $400-500 on courses might just jeopardize your career.
    
- Can finish quant and verbal videos in 2-3 months.
    

# TARGET TEST PREP (TTP)

- The best course for those who are weak in quant.
    
- TTP is famous for getting most of its students to that Q48-50 range. How do they do that? They drill you on every concept that you need to know to perform on the GMAT. You'll get these amazing notes on every concept and can note it down in your notebook or highlight them on the TTP platform for summarizing. If you haven't gone through quant or you were never good at quant then my friend, TTP is your savior.
    
- I won't hype up their verbal course because I didn't use it much but it is decent. Their verbal easy questions feel like 700+ GMAT so I avoided doing those. Their verbal course is new but considering their standards for quant, I'm sure their verbal is great as well.
    
- You need 5-6 months just to finish their quant course. Unfortunately, perfection comes at a price. Due to the fact that they try to ensure a high quant score, they make you do a ton of exercises which can be time consuming. But I guess you need to struggle in order to get that Q50.
    

# E-GMAT (VERBAL)

- I cannot stress this enough. My fellow brothers and sisters of the Indian subcontinent, get E-GMAT. It is customized for non native speakers i.e., yes, the basics. You need to be spot on with your basics to cross the V35 wall.
    
- They explain everything with these amazing examples. They'll first explain a certain noun or verb and then give you an example to help you understand how the game of GMAT works. Their SC course is probably the best SC course on the market. Native speakers, if you're struggling with SC, go ahead and get E-GMAT SC.
    
- Do not buy their quant and do not use their mocks. I haven't been to hell but if hell does exist, it looks like E-GMAT quant. Horrible questions and horrible explanations. Save your money and buy something else for quant. The worst quant prep material.
    
- You need 2-3 months just to get through their verbal.
    

# MANHATTAN (BOOKS)

- I had to return them since preparing from books isn't for me but I'll still give my review.
    
- From what I read and what I have been told about these books, they are the best if you are looking to prepare from books.
    
- Should take you 3-4 months, maybe even more to finish these books.
    
- They are costly, yes, but get these books and you won't need anything else. They have everything.
    

# GMAT OG Bundle

- Amazing books but why buy when you can get those questions with even better explanations on GMAT Club Forum.
    
- If you did purchase these books then stop what you're doing, visit [https://www.efficientlearning.com/pin/activate/](https://www.efficientlearning.com/pin/activate/) and activate your book codes to use their online software. Create your own sets as per your own needs to get the best out of those questions.
    
- Please note that there won't be much difference between the latest edition and the previous year's edition. Only a few questions are added each year to each book so don't buy the new one. But if you have an old edition such as 2016 or 2017 then go ahead and buy the 2021 or 2022 edition.
    

# GMAT NINJA

- Even if you are new to GMAT prep, you already know this legend. He is a GMAT God and should be taken seriously.
    
- His YouTube video on the GMAT Club Forum channel were quite helpful. He doesn't explain the basics but you get to understand his thought process and use it for yourself.
    
- I used his SC and CR videos and I'm glad I did. They provided me with a lot of clarity and helped me set the perfect mindset for myself to solve those verbal questions.
    
- Also, go through his blogs [https://www.gmatninja.com/](https://www.gmatninja.com/) in which he explains many important things about how to prepare and what to focus on.
    

# MOCKS

- I'll keep this short and sweet because I don't want to type more.
    
- Official mocks are considered the best mocks but not for me. They are outdated. Their scoring algorithm is spot on for verbal and so are their questions but their quant questions are outdated and easy. You will not get such easy questions on the real thing so if you are getting Q50 on official mocks then just assume you are at Q47.
    
- Manhattan mocks are good for those aiming for Q50 but they're quite demotivating. Trust me, you'll get demotivated when you score 700 on official mocks but 600-630 on Manhattan mocks.
    
- Kaplan mocks are the best, in my arrogant opinion. Their quant questions seemed a little tough but their scoring algorithm is the most accurate.
    
- Veritas mocks are somewhat similar to Manhattan mocks in terms of difficulty so that should answer your queries.
    
- GMAT Club Forum mocks are great for those aiming for that Q51. I haven't seen anything this tough since my CAT prep (Indian entrance exam).
    

# PLEASE NOTE:

- I have not been paid to write these reviews. I have seen negative comments about TTP and E-GMAT, stating that many reviews on reddit and GMAT Club Forum are fake. I can assure you that I wasn't paid a single rupee by any company. Trust me, I'd love to take their money since COVID has hurt my family financially but no, I wasn't paid for this.
    
- GMAT is no joke. Pleased don't ask how you can go from 500 to 700 because it is almost impossible. I'm sorry but someone had to say it.
    
- GMAT quant is evolving. Ask anyone who gave GMAT recently and most of them will tell you that GMAT questions are different now. They might not be hard but they are different.
    
- Please focus on your basics. As Elvis once said, "only fools rush in".
    
- There is no "best course". Every course is amazing but it just might not be a good fit for you.
    
- Also, I apologize if my statements seemed arrogant. I know I might be wrong but I just shared my honest opinions.
    
- DM me if you need any help.
    
- Please just upvote this. I don't charge anything. I just wanted to help the community
