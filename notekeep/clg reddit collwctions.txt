It's more appropriate to think of as a tier of uber elite undergrads instead of just "Top 10". The US schools with the best undergrad reputation are Ivy Plus (8 ivies + Stanford, MIT, Duke, Chicago, CalTech so 13 schools), but recently schools like JHU and Northwestern have risen in the USNews rankings and into USNews "T10" so many A2Cers consider them at the same level as Ivy Plus, so that's already 15 schools at the elite level. Then among these 15, the standouts are HYPSM. Then then the rest are shifted in whatever personal preference to make your "top 10". But really these 13-15 schools are pretty much consensus the most prestigious US undergrads. The next tier are the more regionally prestigious private schools like WashU, Rice, Vanderbilt, Notre Dame, Emory etc.. along with the top public schools like UVA, Berkeley, UCLA etc...



-------------------------------------------------------------

Lol whoever told you Yale wasnt good enough at anything is insane. Graduate is a bit more by program but itâ€™s not like anything is going to be unprestigious at one of the top schools.


-------------------------------------------------------------



At the undergraduate level:

Harvard

Stanford

MIT

Yale

Princeton

Columbia

Penn

Caltech

Chicago

Duke




-------------------------------------------------------------



Hereâ€™s how I would break it down (of course different schools are stronger for different programs, this is just an overall sense):

Schools without ED and without special scholars programs: Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Princeton, Caltech. These are the only schools desirable enough to not need ED or special recruitment/scholars programs to entice people.

Top Schools with ED and/or special scholars programs: Yale, Duke, Columbia, Penn, Brown, Dartmouth, Northwestern

Top Schools with multiple ED rounds and/or special scholars programs + top LACs: UChicago, Johns Hopkins, Vanderbilt, WashU, Cornell, Rice, Williams, Amherst, Pomona, Bowdoin, Swarthmore





------------------------------------------------------------


It depends way too much on where you live for there to be a single answer to your question.

For example, I live in the same state as an elite LAC thatâ€” while having career opportunities comparable to iviesâ€” is basically unheard of outside of upper class circles. But within my state, itâ€™s very well regarded even by the kind of people who donâ€™t even think of going to college. People are going to be more impressed if you go to Duke and live in North Carolina, go to Emory/Spelman in Georgia, etc. but career opportunities are well distributed throughout all elite schools.

Youâ€™re gonna have similar chances of success at any school once you get into a certain tier, but for impressing the average person on the street? Itâ€™s regional outside of HYPSM

--------------------------



It depends on how you rank. And to be honest, it's really just Harvard/MIT/Stanford/Oxbridge (Oxford and Cambridge) globally. And mostly just Harvard and MIT:

Harvard, MIT, Stanford, UCB, Oxford, Cambridge, Princeton, CalTech, ETH Zurich, Tsinghua

-----------------------------------

Seems like Tsinghua and Peking are pretty equal in global prestige so itâ€™s hard to include one but not the other.

-------------------



Doing for STEM because that's what I know best.

MIT, Stanford, Harvard, Cambridge, Oxford, Princeton, Caltech, ETH Zurich, Imperial

Edit: Iâ€™m fucking stupid thatâ€™s nine Iâ€™d add either tsinghua or cal I guess

------------------------------------------------



Harvard, Cambridge and Oxford, MIT, Stanford, Princeton, Yale, Caltech, UPenn, Columbia

---------------------------



Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Princeton, MIT, Caltech, Imperial, Stanford,

last 2 are harder so Iâ€™ll just throw a few out and any of them could be in it I think: UofT, Berkley, Yale, Penn, UCL

Only included English speaking unis because Iâ€™m not really knowledgeable about places like Zurich, Tsinghau, etc even though they are obviously great

-------------------------------



Harvard, Cambridge, Oxford, MIT, Stanford, ETH Zurich, Imperial, NUS, Yale, Princeton Iâ€™d say. CalTech honorable mention but it just hasnâ€™t been a household name for that long, at least where Iâ€™m from

Nothing ever stays the same. Some people still think Rockerfeller more influential than Apple - things change.

They laughed when MIT and Stanford climbed above Yale, Princeton, Cornell etc. Do you know how those 2 did it? This way: https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/economics/article/how-imperial-beat-oxbridge-and-the-secrets-to-winning-a-place-qfnqsxd9n

Imperial now has White City campus... only UK university matching MIT and Stanford for incubator capability. Consider that if you're an undergraduate.

1 year exchange program with MIT - something else to consider. You'll also be happy to know Imperial undergrads tend to have deeper subject knowledge when the do the exchange because of UK educational system (from day 1 focused on subject you're studying).

https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/student-life/imperial-education/study-abroad/mit-exchange/

Not 1 mickey mouse degree at Imperial... all very relevant STEM degrees. Plus, top investment banking recruitment choice in London, look it up.

It also doesn't hurt to know that Imperial students have highest average salary for any UK university 3 years after leaving Uni. So employers are backing Imperial by putting their money on the line. What do they know that we don't?

Number 1 for salary when you graduate in Europe. https://www.studyin-uk.com/india/study-guide/top-10-uk-universities-high-earning-graduates/

Number 1 for research

Number 1 for sustainability

Number 1 for Incubator capabilities in Europe https://www.imperial.ac.uk/white-city-campus/

Number 1 for location in the UK (South Kensington - safe, rich in heritage and... just rich)

Most students will care about the first and last point above. You want to get paid, but you also want to party hard in one of the best cities in the world (London). Well... Imperial students don't party... story for another day ðŸ˜€ (it's a tough Uni to survive!)



---------------------------



What should the order be, and provide justification. It's not good enough to go on name recognition alone. MIT and Imperial College (+CIT etc) have an advantage since they only focus on STEM. I suspect this will become the trend, since these universities are more likely to have research that impacts at a global scale. Interestingly, Imperial College has more post-Grad students than under-grad - think about all that research! Many of these post-grads are top candidates from other leading Universities. An argument for Imperial College (global impact past 5 years) for example would be (keep in mind, Rankings are nonsense):

Global Impact Research (i.e. considered for these Rankings):

Imperial College researchers, led by Professor Robin Shattock, have been working on mRNA vaccine technology for several years. This was first extensively used to develop COVID-19 vaccines in 2020.

Researchers are developing machine learning algorithms that can analyze medical images (X-rays, MRIs) with improved accuracy and speed, potentially leading to earlier diagnoses and better treatment decisions

Food allergies: A recent trial showed promise in allowing children with food allergies to eat without fear of serious reactions

Earlier diagnosis of neurological conditions like MS and epilepsy through new MRI scanning methods

Personalized medicine advancements by Professor Christofer Toumazou's team

Imperial College London is a leader in the fight against drug-resistant infections. They launched the Fleming Initiative in 2024, a collaborative effort to tackle this global health threat.

Imperial established the QuEST project (Quantum Engineering Science and Technology) to focus on this rapidly developing field. Leading research on quantum computing, communication, and sensing has been carried out with the potential to revolutionize various sectors

The College has the Artificial Intelligence Network and Imperial-X, dedicated groups analyzing the ethical and societal impact of AI while exploring its applications in healthcare, engineering, and other areas

Researchers are developing new materials and storage solutions for renewable energy sources like solar and wind power.

Researchers are developing new battery technologies for electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage. This includes projects on solid-state batteries and lithium-sulfur batteries, aiming for higher capacity, faster charging, and improved safety

New tools for designing pile foundations for offshore wind farms and oil rigs

Imperial College is the leading university in Light Technology (Holograms, Blu-ray etc.)

Reason to go there...
As a grad (Masters/PhD) why go to Imperial (Top 5 programs) : Imaging technology (MRI/X-ray etc), Medicine - Medical Research, Light Technology (Holograms etc), Material Science

Hi! Iâ€™m an international who is very interested in going to an American (or UK) university. Where I am from (Singapore), we have NUS which is an amazing institution and Iâ€™d be very happy to go there, but I would really love to try a western school because the teaching is more open and flexible, and Iâ€™d consider staying there after required military service. However, I donâ€™t go to one of the major schools in Singapore (Raffles or Hwa Chong or even SAS) so I might have a tough time getting into the best universities. For us it generally is:

Class 1: Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Oxford, Cambridge

Class 2: Princeton, Duke, Yale, U of Penn. Wharton, Cal Tech, Columbia,

Class 3: U of Chic., UCL, Imperial, LSE, Northwestern, Berkeley

Class 4: Cornell, Brown, Johns Hopkins, Dartmouth, Williams, Amherst, Pomona, Carnegie Mellon

Class 5: UCLA, Vanderbilt, Rice, NYU, U of Mich., U of Virginia, U of Southern Calif., Georgia Tech

I donâ€™t believe I will make a Class 1 American institution, maybe I will try for Oxbridge. I am mostly aiming for Class 2 and several of the rest, with NUS as my option if I canâ€™t get to the US. What are perceptions of these schools like in other parts of the world, specifically America, so I can correct my list?
