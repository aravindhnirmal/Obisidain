- Magoosh's GRE Math Bible and Manhattan's Quantitative Compendium for targeted practice, and use GRE Focused on Quantitative Reasoning for additional drills.
-  ETS official material in their books and as many of the practice tests as you have time for. You'll also need to make sure you actually know all the concepts tested - check out the ETS Math Review.



Gregmat videos. Gremat mini quizzes, Manhattan LB, and GRE Prep Club. The idea is to maintain rhythm and learn new concepts every day. Practice and practice and practice. Study the quant flashcards, build up the fundamentals and maintain an error log comprising of the mistakes and the solutions to the same. This is very important.

Practice minimum 20 questions every day - no matter how easy they are. Gregmat has tons of content out there, as well as GRE Prep club. Plus, I have an engineering background, so quants doesn't really bug me the most ( I'm aware I bombed in the final test - more of that later ).

**Verbal Preparation :**

So, here's the thing - I'm an Indian, hence a non native english speaker. I bombed my last GRE Verbal section and here's what helped me this time round :

- **Gregmat vocab mountain** : This is the holy grail of GRE vocab - maybe I'm exaggerating a little, but the point being you NEED to mug up these words and practice out hundreds of question in GRE prepclub as well as the Gregmat quizzes. This WILL NOT come naturally to you and you have to develop the acumen slowly and steadily.It will only come with practice. Learn how Greg teaches to approach text completion in the first place and practice. The most important thing about text completion is to understand the connotation behind a particular word and the context presented by the sentence. Learn and practice as much as possible and one fine day it will come naturally to you.More importantly, build your own Vocab mountain. Always make a log of the words you got wrong in a mock exam for instance, eventually you'll see that your own vocab mountain is more exhaustive and attuned to your knowledge base. You'll relate more to it when you encounter the words again - and trust me you will. Spend atleast 10-15 mins revising the sets. This will take time and cannot be done within a week or so. It will take a few weeks minimum but again, it's subjective and might take significantly less time for native english speakers.
    
- **RC's** : Here's the big boy in Vocab. Last time around, I was very afraid of RC's. This time around - not so much. I did my best and eventually got a respectable score. Here's how I approach RC's :- **Be a Lawyer** : Always look for evidence. ALWAYS. I think this is also something that Greg has been stressing lately. If you cannot find an evidence and can't infer it from the passage either - BOUNCE. It's not the answer. GRE RC's are very very tricky and the options play around with the words a lot, so you need to very cautious. I typically focus a lot on the smaller passages because it's easier. It's also highly likely that if you are scrutinizing every detail in the passage, you'll most likely get the correct answer. I attempt the longer passage ( typically question 9 - 11 ), at the end when I have time. I do not advocate this process, but it works for me. It also might be the difference between getting 162 and 166. But hey, verbal isn't something that comes naturally to me. I am not an avid english speaker nor do I read a lot of books - but greg's approach and subsequent practice helped me a bit.- **DO NOT OVERTHINK** : GRE RC's don't require you to think a lot. Play within the walled garden.Never bring out your own reasoning or suggestions with regards to the passage. You not only save a lot of time by not overthinking but also prevent yourself from falling for trap answers.
    

**Writing** : Not worth spending much time on this facet of GRE. Watch a few videos, understand the structure and you should be good to go. I didn't worry since I can type fast - and for fast typers, writing shouldn't be much of an issue. But, kindly cross check your essays and try as much as possible to minimize spelling mistakes. Try to express your thoughts and ideas as plainly as possible.

imilar to Manhattan 5LB and GregMat medium and easy questions or to GregMat hard and extreme questions. Also how many questions on the test were GregMat hard questions level difficulty? In regards to RC practice, what books did you refer to


**Test Day**

Nothing much really - I tried to sleep well. Took some medication that put me to sleep around 12 am and I woke up at 5. Relaxed, went for a run. Didn't speak a word and listened to Hans Zimmer Cornfield Chase haha. It calms me down. Ludwig Göransson's, 'Can you hear the music' is also nice. My mind races a lot, almost intractable, recalcitrant and mulish ( in GRE words lol ). But yeah, arrived at the centre and got started. I know I bombed the quants. My score isn't representative of my abilities but it's just that I couldn't control myself from going back and redoing a particular curveball of a question that took me 4-5 mins to solve. I solved it but the time was gone. Throughout the exam I couldn't help but think of something that caused me a lot of pain lately. In twitter lingo, it's been on my mind rent free. It's horrible but hopefully most folks don't face that. I believe the lack of sheer focus cost me a 330 score. I messed up my quants and I feel horrible about it but you know what, I'm bloody proud of myself. Life keeps coming at me and I keep facing it head on. I will never give up.

FYI, the quants is definitely NOT getting harder. I gave it last year and I gave it again last week. There are a few curveballs here and there and you need to get your mind under control lest you should end up like me. Do not force yourself to solve a question - time will never be on your side. You feel you're not able to crack a question ? BOUNCE ! You feel you are not arriving at an answer despite doing everything right? BOUNCE ! You feel a question is too long and you'd like to face it later ? BOUNCE !! I ran out of time. Some questions are tricky, they were always tricky ! If it was easy everyone would've scored > 167 . You cannot really do anything about it. The only way to go about it is to buy yourself more time by quickly wrapping up the easy ones. Also, read the questions carefully - I am aware I made a mistake by ignoring a notation. I had to redo the problem and it costed me 2 additional mins. These are rookie mistakes and I've nothing to say in my defense. I've messed up, but hopefully if things don't work out for me with this score, I'll prep again and come out with a comprehensive guide to score 330+.




1. Figure out which programs in which universities you aspire to the most. Search on the internet and find out what your target score should be for both Quants and Verbal.
    
2. Understand the paper pattern of GRE. Focus on how many questions you can afford to skip/ get incorrect without falling below your target score. This is important as requiring to get 16 correct out of 20 could mean that you can afford to skip an entire reading comprehension.
    
3. For Quants, Manhattan 5 lb GRE prep book should be sufficient. Learn all the concepts in them thoroughly and solve as many questions as you can. Solving means you must solve to the final answer. If your answer is incorrect, take 2 minutes to identify what was the mistake you had made. Note down the mistakes in a separate notebook for quant and try to ensure that you don't repeat that mistake again.
    
4. Let's talk about vocabulary. Download the Magoosh GRE Vocab Flashcard app, no need to cover all difficulty levels. I skipped the last difficulty level and still had a strong vocabulary for a good score. To learn the new words, I had a separate notebook where I listed out the new word(s) that I came across at any time during my prep. I used to go over this list every single day and eventually learned a lot of words from here.
    
5. For Verbal, understand that there are 3 types of questions. RCs (Reading Comprehension), FIB (Fill in the blanks) and SE (Sentence Equivalence). A thumb rule I followed is that, if there is a critical word in the question that I do not understand I immediately skipped it as there is a high chance that without understanding that one word my answer would be incorrect.
    
6. Understand the nuances of each question type (There is a lot of depth to each question type) and have a rough estimate of how much time you will need for each question type. Remember that giving the GRE is like chasing a T20 score, you need to maintain a high run rate to do succeed eventually.
    
7. Give practice exams in brief intervals, if you are hesitant to give one at the start that's fine. But definitely evaluate yourself after 2 weeks of prep at the latest. For practice exams don't hesitate to buy an online test series (Magoosh, Manhattan, Kaplan etc. Research on your own). This is because, they generally provide invaluable insights on your strengths, weaknesses etc which is very important for you to rework your prep strategy.
    
8. This will be a stressful time, don't get discouraged and do not give up! All the very best for your exam!!!


One word.GregMat


Here is a really good collection of some useful GRE preparation material: [https://gradpeer.gumroad.com/](https://gradpeer.gumroad.com/), especially for self-studying.

Hope it helps!




Just got my official results (screenshot below). I actually didn't believe my eyes on test day, I was convinced I was doing poorly during the test, so I waited for the official results to come in. Hopefully me sharing my preparation can help some of you all studying right now.

![r/GRE - Just got a 337 without spending any money on prep! Here are my Tips and Experiences (long post incoming)](https://preview.redd.it/xwifwzrn5mz71.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=21e81936d9515e38e1828ac107964d717fb7eae3)

Background on me - I am American. I graduated college in May with a STEM degree. I work full-time so finding time to study was an issue. I started studying in august for like 3 weeks. Then work picked up, NFL started, and I became less motivated. I re-found that motivation in October, studied for 2 more weeks and took the test in person at a testing center on November 6th.

**Quant** -

_**Tips**_

- For the Quantitative Comparison Questions, make sure you know what **numbers to plug in** to make sure there isn't a special case
    
    - 1, -1 - make sure it works for both positive and negative numbers
        
    - 0 - some weird cases with 0. make sure to try
        
    - .5, -.5 - if there is any squared term, a number whose absolute value is <1 will go down, make sure any equation with a squared term works for both numbers greater and less than 1
        
- If the numbers you got for A and B are too far apart, you might have done something wrong. A is not going to equal 112 if B equals 5.
    
- Quant comp questions are like an equation, meaning anything you can do between two sides of an inequality, you can do to quantities A and B
    
- Read the questions carefully, some of them will switch up units or ask for something unexpected at the end of the question
    
- Be prepared for all topics. [This person's math notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/GRE/comments/ordw02/my_gre_notes_reuploaded/) on this subreddit is pretty good at highlighting all the topics. For me, interest, work/rates, combinations/permutations, and prime factorization were the topics I were least comfortable with at the start.
    
- **GRE likes to waste your time**. If you think the answer is D, don't waste time. Having a good feeling of what is unanswerable is an important skill.
    
- I've seen some people like to do Quant comp questions last. For me, I liked starting with these, because coming off a verbal section, these are the least verbose questions. I also find they are the quickest to do But do what is best for you.
    
- There are resources on reddit for all of the PP tests. [https://www.reddit.com/r/GREpreparation/comments/cj4jyh/google_sheets_answer_key_to_all_640_questions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GREpreparation/comments/cj4jyh/google_sheets_answer_key_to_all_640_questions/)
    

_**Test Day Experience**_

- I though my test day quant sections were **harder than practice**(common opinion). I was way more pressed for time and even couldn't answer a question. But I do think that the grading curve must be more generous as the test gets harder.
    
- I had VQVQV. Even though math is by strong suit, I was happy about this. I put more pressure on myself during quant because i expected a high score, so I was glad to not have an extra session of that.
    
- I do think the second one was slightly harder, which makes sense
    

**Verbal** - This was not my strong suit, I am shocked I improved so much from practice.

_**Tips**_

- I did the section in **increasing order of question length**. Meaning I did the fill in the blanks, then the text completion, then the smaller paragraphs through the largest one. For me, it's tough to do the longest reading in the middle because it can take up to a third of the time. How can you spend so much time focused when you know you have half the test left? Putting it at the end allowed me to completely focus on it.
    
- Vocab! Vocab! Vocab! I would watch the TestedTutor videos to help [https://www.youtube.com/c/TheTestedTutor](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheTestedTutor). What I learned from him is that **mnemonics** are really important to remembering a word.
    
    - For example - Insipid - if a drink is insipid, you would Sip-it instead of chugging. I used that to remember that insipid means lacking flavor.
        
    - [https://mnemonicdictionary.com/](https://mnemonicdictionary.com/) has some helpful mnemonics for most words.
        
- For reading comprehension, understand the types of questions they ask. Selecting a sentence, strengthening the argument, asking what certain people in the passage might think about something.
    
    - A plug for [https://greprepclub.com/](https://greprepclub.com/). They have so many questions for different sources. I would do 100s of practice questions, particularly with reading.
        
- I know you don't want to spend too long on a question, but I'd suggest spending a little extra time if you're stuck on a reading question. Coming back to it at the end is less helpful because you're now more distanced from the passage that it's based on.
    
- For fill in the blanks and sentence equivalent questions, [gregmat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCktwzce9ncy_K78l1KBZkYQ) videos are great . He is really good at making hard questions formulaic.
    
- Some **people suggesting taking notes while reading. I am very against this**. I found it distracting and time consuming to try to take notes while reading a passage. Instead, I would read the sentence slowly, multiple times if necessary, and rephrase it in my head if it was a difficult sentence.
    

_**Test Day Experience**_

- I had VQVQV. Could not tell which was experimental. They all seemed the same difficulty to me.
    
- During the last V, I was so sure I underperformed on the whole test that I just wanted to click next, finish up, and get it over with. If you are feeling the same way by that last section, **fight that urge**, finish strong.
    
- The sentence equivalence are definitely the easiest if you know your vocab.
    

**AWA**

_**Tips**_

- I relied fully on [gregmat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCktwzce9ncy_K78l1KBZkYQ) for this. He has great outlines for each essay that makes the essays easy to write. The intros and conclusions especially can be very templated.
    
- I would also watch his videos to see what types of assumptions you can call out in the argument essay. I found a lot of the assumptions dumb, like when the prompt mentions a survey, you can basically automatically write that they assume the survey was done properly. My test day prompt had a survey, a comparison to results ten years prior, and a causation/correlation, so it basically wrote itself.






1. I think every GRE resource provides a very similar list of words. There are just some words that are GRE words. The difference is that some places just give you the list, some give index cards, some have multiple choice, etc. Id say find what works best for you and stick to that list. The list I stuck too was probably about 1000 words, but like half I already knew. I wouldn't say I went too obscure with the words.
    
2. I would not say I'm naturally gifted at verbal. I've always been good at math, but for the verbal sections I was taking mid studying, I was usually getting 12-15 Qs out of 20. My goal on test day was like 160-163. But I guess the studying payed off more than I anticipated
    
3. I actually like the critical reasoning questions. For me, i would do those first out of all the readings. I felt like those were the shortest and clearest passages. Those questions are more about understanding the argument as opposed to being able to comprehend a complex passage. I'd usually just read each answer carefully and be aware of what may be out of scope or what ETS may try to trick me with. Sometimes you can map out the argument, as in the passage is saying Reason 1 leads to Reason 2 which leads to Conclusion. So to weaken the argument I can show that Reason 2 doesn't necessarily lead to Conclusion or the Conclusion happens because of a different Reason.




ery much different! Quants you may say is kinda same in terms of syllabus. But, English is way too off. Your verbal need to be damn good and RC difficulty is higher in GRE. Apart from that, I would say CAT is more of selection based exam, whereas GRE is time based exam. So, managing time to answer every question becomes crucial in GRE, in CAT you can do 7-8 Q. net correct out of 22 in Quant and be in 98-99 percentile.

So, GRE needs its own strategy, preparation, mocks. You can't rely only on CAT prep for GRE exam
