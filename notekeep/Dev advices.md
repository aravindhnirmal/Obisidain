- Open source contribution is not something that any fresher can just do. Contributing anything to a project would require you to already possess significant technical skills.

- Leetcode is specifically designed to get new and experience folks up to speed with programming paradigms, with problems designed to use a particular algorithm or data structure.

- If you are looking for jobs, go for leetcode, to improve speed go for competitive programming. If you are looking to give something back to the community and learn things in the process, do open source.

----------------



1. College (fresher) or previous company -> cv selection
    
2. Leetcode -> screening/coding round
    
3. Open source / system Design/ -> technical rounds / hiring manager
    
4. Lying -> Hr round


-----------------


Leetcode for inexperienced. Leetcode+GitHub profile for the hop from the first job to next. Would highly depend on the Organisations interviewing process though.

I will share my personal opinion:  
- Open Source code : Open Source code is what helps to build your developer profile. It is code that you have written which is readily available for anyone to look at and understand your coding abilities. Granted most companies in India don't put the effort to check opensource code but it doesn't mean that it can't be a reason to land a good opportunity.

- Leetcode: There are a lot of engineers, graduates, bootcampers, who are looking for a tech job. Leetcode is like being eligible for an IIT by giving JEE mains. It sets you apart from the crowd and makes it easier to get in a high paying job. I would suggest neetcode to start with leetcode as it has a more guided approach.

- Competitive programming: This is similar to leetcode but added advantages especially if conducted offline. You get to meet like minded people. If you are the smartest in the room, your knowledge doesn't grow. But if there are more smart people, that helps you to learn from them and grow. Networking is important. There is also more to competitive programming, learning new things in a short period of time, among others.

All of these can be helpful to build a profile. You can either choose one or find a balance, see what works for you. There is nothing like you need to do all or you should do only one. See what is fun for you, what you enjoy doing.



-------------
Open source is actual software engineering, if you work on a large project, you will learn how to fix things and do refactoring. Not that helpful for job searching unless your project is in same domain. For example if you wrote code for open source database, it will help you for database companies but not everywhere.

Leetcode will help in strengthening DSA, very helpful for interviews, somewhat helpful for job because it will develop your analytical thinking but most of work in Industry is not hardcore algorithm design.

Competitive programming: helps you think faster but may not help you be a great developer because you need to cut corners in program design and write fast. All profiles whether it's architect, dev or QA must be given sufficient time to write reliable, maintainable software. What I mean is, competitive programmers often forget about SOLID principles, design patterns etc , that code is mostly not generic and rarely extendable.

Hey, I (21M) am currently working as a Software Developer. I've been getting lots and lots of DMs regarding how do I get a job, how i prepared for it and queries regarding that. I'll try to cover maximum such questions here in this post.

A little about me -> I did my B-Tech from a Tier 1 college and i used to teach my juniors Competitive Programming and DSA there (completely free), and these all resources, list and advices are just a compilation of what all i learnt throughout my teaching journey.

My advice to everyone in their 1st/2nd year is become good at competitive programming(CP) rather than just focusing on basic DSA. DSA is just a small portion of questions/topics, CP trains your mind how to think when a certain problem arises, this is exactly what big IT companies look for, the ability to find effective and efficient solution to new problems quickly. DSA is just a some certain pattern of questions that are most frequently asked, but if you have a good grip on CP, solving DSA problems will not be a big deal for you.

My recommendation would be start with **C++ language**, as its the most preferred language in CP/DSA

So now coming to the topics/roadmap that i covered, i started CP from my 2nd semester of Btech.  
You can start from

**LUV C++ youtube channel -> The best resource for CP** watch the entire video thoroughly and practice the questions given in description. Practice similar questions on **HackerEarth, Codeforces, Codechef**  
Cover all the topics from his playlist, this is the bare minimum.

The following topics are very important with respect to placements and interviews, so along with LUV C++ playlist you need to cover them from a lot of other resources

**Dynamic Programming** -> In addition to Luv C++, go through **ADITYA VERMA's DP PLAYLIST** and practice a lot a lot of questions of Dynamic Programming

**Graphs** -> Go through **CODE N CODE's Graph Playlist** 1 & 2 (1 is a must do) and practice a lot a lot of questions of Graphs

**Binary Search** -> Go through **CODEFORCES EDU** videos and try to solve the practice questions yourself

**Two Pointers** -> Go through **CODEFORCES EDU** videos and try to solve the practice questions yourself

**SegTree, Lazy Propagation, Binary Lifting, LCA** (very advanced topics only asked in top companies) -> **CODE N CODE**

**Fenwick Tree** -> **LUV C++** (old videos where he explained everything on the whiteboard)

**DSU** -> **LUV C++** and **STRIVER** **(TAKE U FORWARD)**

Don't just focus on covering these topics, try to learn how to approach a new problem cause most big companies will be asking you questions that have never been asked before and you should know how to approach them.

**THROUGHOUT THE JOURNEY OF LEARNING THESE CONCEPTS, TRY TO GIVE AS MUCH CONTESTS AS YOU CAN, ON CODEFORCES, CODECHEF wherever you can**

**THERE IS NO BETTER WAY OF LEARNING HOW TO THINK THAN TO GIVE CONTESTS, after each contest try to solve atleast one more question that you were not able to solve in the contest.(UP-SOLVING)**

**-------------------------- DSA ROUTE ------------------------------------**

If you just want to go through DSA (3rd year) quickly, and dont want to follow the CP route, just go through these topics and do them thoroughly. But as it's just a shortcut, so don't expect the results to be same as the ones you ll be getting after following the CP route.

**PREFER CP ROUTE IF YOU HAVE TIME**

Those who have already gone through the CP route, these topics below will not take much time and you can quickly wrap up on them in 3 months. Just practice their questions on **LEETCODE** and you ll be a DSA GOD

1. Arrays (Questions Practice)
    
2. Strings Algorithm (Striver + CodeNCode)
    
    1. **KMP**, **Rabin Karp (must)**
        
3. Maths (Questions Practice)
    
    1. Number Theory, Combinatorics
        
4. Binary Search (Codeforces EDU + Luv C++ Yt)
    
5. Bit Manipulation (Questions Practice)
    
6. Two Pointers (Codeforces EDU)
    
7. Linked List (Striver)
    
8. Stack & Queues (Striver)
    
9. Recursion & Backtracking (Striver)
    
10. Hashing (Questions Practice)
    
11. Heaps & Maps (Striver + Aditya Verma for Heaps)
    
12. Binary Tree & BST (Striver)
    
13. DP & dp with bitmasking (Aditya Verma + Striver DP playlist)
    
14. Graphs (CodeNCode + Striver + Luv C++ Yt)
    
15. DFS, BFS, TopoSort
    
16. Shortest Path Algos (Dijkstra, Bellman Ford, Floyd Warshall)
    
17. MST (Prim’s & Kruskal)
    
18. Articulation Points & Bridges (very rarely asked)
    
19. Strongly Connected Components (Kosaraju’s Algo)
    
20. LCA (Binary Lifting)
    
21. Hamiltonian Path (directly asked in coding rounds)
    
22. Trie (Striver)
    
23. DSU (Striver + Luv C++ Yt )
    
24. SegTree (CodeNCode), Lazy Propagation(CodeNCode), Fenwick Tree (Luv C++)
    

Along with DSA, practicing questions on **LEETCODE** is a must. **Pick up a DSA sheet like STRIVER 450 DSA SHEET and solve it completely**. Along with it you can complete the entire problem list of **InterviewBIT**.

**------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Try to reach an **EXPERT ON CODEFORCES & 1900+ rating on LEETCODE.** Boosts up the resume and once you are on this level, cracking a job in a big high paying MNC is not a big deal for you.

**IF YOU WANT TO BECOME REALLY GOOD AT CP, GO THROUGH CSES QUESTIONS LIST**

**Some questions & answers -**

**Q1. Did i solve all of them myself?**  
A. Yes and Yes, i did both CP & DSA, i solved around 1500+ questions combined of both. I've personally gone through a lot of other resources as well, but the ones that i have put here are the finest ones.

**Q2. Is doing all this worth it?**  
A. At the position I'm currently at, i can tell that every single minute that i dedicated to this is worth it. The salary that gets credited in my bank account at the end of every month is only cause I did all this hustle and hardwork.

**Q3. Question i receive a lot in DMs -> Im from Tier 3/Private college, can i still get a good placement?**

A. Yes you can, by believing that you cant grab a good placement you are actually finding excuses of not putting in efforts. I've seen Tier3 college students grabbing really good packages. You just have to work hard, you may not get the peer group that guys in Tier 1/2 colleges will get, but you can still work hard and get to their level by compensating the college drawback with good skills.

**Q4. Am i doing all this just cause i want to sell a course or earn money ?**  
A. Haha, nah i already earn enough and I'm writing this post just to help you folks grab good placements and improve the lifestyle of you and your families. My sole aim is to help all my juniors in their journey, so i can contribute back to the society.

**Q5. I have XYZ months left, what can i do now?**  
A. Just stop complaining and start practicing. Only you can help yourself. Noone is gonna come to save you once you are sitting in front of an interviewer.

**Q6. How much do I earn?**

A. Good enough to be proud, low enough to keep hustling for more.

So now you folks dont have any excuse of not putting in efforts, you have all the required resources and the complete roadmap. JUST START PRACTICING.

To all the experienced folks, i tried to mention everything in this post, but if i still missed out on something, add your advice in the comment section. _I ll include that in the post._

If any of you still have any queries, feel free to use the comment section.

**HAPPY CODING :)**

Also, if you solve plenty problems you should at some point begin to see patterns since you already have solved similar problems.

Next: being a good _competitive programmer_ does by far not mean you are a _good programmer_.

Competitive programming has next to nothing to do with _real world_ programming, rather the opposite. Competitive programming is all about quick and dirty, not clean code, not handling all edge cases, etc. It focuses on small, isolated, mainly mathematically oriented/DSA oriented problems with often using some obscure algorithms.

If you want to become a _good_ programmer, you have to program applications, large scale programs, not isolated algorithmic problems. You have to learn to focus on clean code, modular, reusable code, testability and testing, clean architecture. You have to learn to create complex systems with many interacting parts, not isolated algorithm problems.

tl;dr: Writing serious code for a real-world project is nothing like competitive programming. (Speaking both as a professional software engineer, and as a former ACM-ICPC world finalist and coach.)

There are certain _specific_ skills that are extremely important to competitive programming, that are also applicable more generally. In particular, being able to read code, quickly come up with a mental model of what it's doing, validate that mental model by comparing against the actual observed behavior, and spot bugs.

However, the kind of problem-solving that you do in programming contests is only a very narrow slice of what professional software developers actually do. In a contest, you don't need to think about integrating with libraries, writing documentation, designing a user-friendly interface, or structuring a codebase for maintainability.

Conversely, in the real world, you almost never need to use sophisticated algorithmic techniques like dynamic programming, or create fancy data structures beyond the ones that are provided by your libraries. It's much more important to be able to create a data _model_ that matches the problem you're solving -- even if that data model can be expressed trivially in terms of existing building blocks.

But as others have said, the kind of CS knowledge (e.g. algorithms and data structures) that is essential to do well at competitive programming _also_ tends to come up during interviews, because many interviewers have a hard time evaluating developers any other way. So knowing it will be helpful in that respect.
