In 2016, I made the decision to take a year off to prepare for the GATE exam. Little did I know, this journey would be quite a rollercoaster, especially because it was my second attempt at cracking GATE.  
  
For the first couple of months, things were going smoothly. I was riding high on motivation. But then, slowly but surely, I started feeling like I was stuck in a time loop.  
  
My friends were out there, securing jobs and moving ahead in their careers. Seeing them, I suddenly felt like I was left behind, like I had made a mistake by not diving straight into the job market.  
  
I started to think that maybe I had taken a step back in my career. Doubts and insecurities began to overshadow my confidence. I even went as far as cutting off communication with my friends.  
  
But, In my mind, I was determined to excel in GATE, as it seemed to be the only way to reclaim my status.  
  
Fortunately, I did well in GATE.  
  
After the GATE exam, a funny thing happened. I realized that none of my friends had given my situation a second thought. They never saw me as an underdog; it was all just in my mind.  
  
If you're in the same boat, let me tell you: it's just you and your mind cooking up this storm. Remember why you chose to take that year off in the first place—you believed in your hard work and potential.  
Your friends’ successes don’t diminish your own. They have their path, and you have yours.  
  
Everyone’s path is different, and there’s no one-size-fits-all route to success. Enjoy being on the path you are on
